4147,2,"Should certaine materials on shelves that are offensive be removed from shelves? I believe that certaine materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that are offensive to people should not be removed from shelves. These materials are taken in perspective by all different kinds of people.     Offensive materials should not be taken off of shelves because something that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another person. People take things differently than other people might. For example, a lady might find a book to be disturbimg or offensive, while the man next to her can find that same book interesting and useful to him. Not one person is the same so not everybody will take offense to the same thing.     I also believe that if someone does not like the object that they are offended by then they do not have to look, purchase, or give attention to that object that is there on the shelve. He or she is not forced to buy, read, or watch what is offending them. The material that is offending that person is not purposley put there to offend them, it is there for people who are interested in it so that they can enjoy theresleves in whatever it is that they might be doing.     Therefore I do not think that materials that are offensive should be taken off of shelves. People have the right to things that they enjoy. A material should not be taken off of a shelve just because one person is offended by it.

1510,1,"I personally believe that computersdo benefit society in a lot of ways. It can give you all the information you need with just a click of a button, entertainment is easy to find by searching the internet, and most importantly, it improves communication between people. One way computers benefit society is, by making it easier for everyone to get information about something. This is needed, especially in school. It can help kids get their information about the person they are writing about in their report.Getting information easily on the internet can also help people in other ways. What if someone needed to get the hospital's phone number in case of an emergency? He can use the computer to help him find that phone number. Another way computers benefit society is by allowing us to get any form of entertainment easily. This is what majority of the people in our society rely on. Alot of people use the computer to play games, listen to music, and watch online videos. If someone was bored right now, he or she could use the computer to play fun games. What if that person thought it was a little quiet in his or her room? He or she could then use the computer to listen to music. Without computers we would probably be really bored for the rest of our lives. Finally, and most importantly, computers help improve communication between people. This is probably what everyone uses the computer for. Now you can send electronic mail to your friends in just seconds, post and view pictures of your family or relatives and you can even use an instant messanger to write to your friend and get messages from your friend in the fastest speed possible! Without computers, communication between others would be very hard. As you can see, computers can give you information easily, entertainment is not hard to find, and it can even improve communication between people around our society and the world.! Computers are very helpful to us and improves everything about the way we live.",4,4,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order for this to be possible, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened which would add an additional cost of @MONEY1.  After the mast was built, the Empire state building faced new problems as well.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable.  After what happened to the Hindenburg, the architects knew that the results would have been much worse in a densely populated area such as New York City.  Another problem was that it was too risky to have a big dirigible hanging above pedestrians a few thousand feet in the air.  The law also hindered Al Smith's idea.  The law stated that airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas.  When the dirigible Los Angeles attempted a trial, builders found that the wind blew too high for the dirigible and they feared it would fly into nearby buildings.  The idea of dirigibles was soon forgotten and gave way to airplanes.",3,3,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My cousin; @CAPS1 and I, are usually together for most of the @DATE1 and the truth is we are not supposed to have energy drinks. @CAPS1's dad; @PERSON1, gave us a monster to split and that day we were going to @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1. After about ten minutes of us drinking the whole monster, me being the one who drank most of it, was the one who was staying calm. @CAPS1 on the other hand, who drank a couple of sips, was going crazy. She was running down the aisles and tripping over her own feet. She almost tipped the cart over with me on the end of it. @ORGANIZATION1 hysterically for no apparent reason is normal for her. Wendy; @PERSON1's wife and my second cousin started to get hungry, so we went to go eat pizza at the @ORGANIZATION2 cafe that is there. My mom had called me and I was trying to get my phone from my pocket to answer while trying to hold on to my plate of hot pizza. I handed my plate to @CAPS1 because my plate was slipping from my grip. She was holding her food in her other hand, she felt the bottom of my plate and said it was really hot so she passed it off to @PERSON1 who wasn't paying attention and he didn't have a good hold on it and my pizza dropped on the floor, pizza side down. It was so embarrassing everybody was looking at us. After that embarrassing moment, @PERSON1 realized that he forgot the churos, so he told @CAPS1 to go get them. All three of us realized his mistake as soon as @CAPS1 left, cause @CAPS1 is a klutz and we probably jinxed it by saying @CAPS1 is probably going to drop them"". We were a little surprised that she hadn't dropped them yet, as soon as we thought that and she set them on the table, one of the churos fell off the table and rolled out of the package. We were @ORGANIZATION1 so hard that we couldn't breathe. @CAPS1 was so embarrassed by her mistake that she turned bright red. We felt bad for poor @CAPS1, but we couldn't help but laugh because of how funny it was. She knew it was funny but she didn't want to laugh at herself. One of the things i usually say is if you can't and aren't willing to laugh at yourself then you aren't having fun. That's why i believe it is so important to laugh cause you gotta learn how to have fun when it is in a situation that you need to laugh at yourself but yet aren't wanting to. That's one of the biggest ways to have fun is by @ORGANIZATION1, because you know you made a small silly mistake that you think everyone in the world saw, all you need is to laugh it off. But you wont cause you feel too embarrassed or too ashamed to admit that you made a little mistake. Sometimes it's your job to go over to them, pat them on the back and tell them that everybody makes mistakes, you gotta learn how to be silly in a tough situation, and that nobody is perfect. Tell them to laugh it off, it helps and you will feel better once you realize that when life knocks you down just get back up cause that's what life is all about. That's the only way you can learn from your mistakes and from life as well. Laughter is really important the more you laugh the better you feel and the better you feel the more fun you will have. Laughter fixes everything, it is a bandage for the little things that happen in life.""",18,15,,33,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,

There is no way possible that computers are bad. for example computers are good for motor skills and what about school work computers help a lot when you forget your homework log at school and lastly sociability! I don't know about you but I couldn't live without computers! Computers teach hand-eye coordination! which we all know we need to play sports! Also with all the typing you do there is definatly some exercise for your wrists! I should know that they do because I woke both my wrists, at the same time and when I went to rehab they told me I should try getting my wrists back to normal by typing and having of calcium but that's another story. Computers are also great for school say that you forget your homework log at school so you don't know what you had for homework well you could call a friend but wouldn't adjust be easier to go online to the teachers webpage? teachers always have there homeworks listed on a school web page.

We can learn wat kind of plantation grow there for food for example tropical places grow bananas and cocanuts. We can learn wat they eat like in @LOCATION1 they eat many beans a lot of there food have beans even there salads. We can find out there language as well maybe they talk spanish like in @LOCATION2. You can also teach hand-eye coordination becase it involves using your fingers and eyes to see what you are typing. You use ur hands on evry thing while typing wether you are typing or you are using the mouse. But it is not just for learning things it is also for freinds becase of al these sites like myspace, facebook, aim, webchat. The posibilities are endless u can even play games. If you dont know someone on face, book, or myspace thats okay it is a great way to meet new people and new freinds. And another thing if u are having trouble findin freind you can just see if they are online. It is good for getting together somwhere or something. And for those pepole who think it is taking away family time you can always just say okay thats enough and talk to them.

Also when he was talking about Spanish, Italian and Cuban all like being a family. Another mood he had was kind of sad.

Also another example is in paragraph @NUM2, where it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done.""

15321,6,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced lots of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem or obsacle they faced was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction. When the air crafts were moored in open fields they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State building they would be dangling high above civilians and pedestrians on the street which caused great a harm for the public.",4,4,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well I agree with them. I strongly belive that computers are tacking time away from you exercising enjoying nature and even interacting with family and friends. Well if you look at teen's this day and how more and more are becauming over weight like back in the days when their wasn't computer or internet not as much people were over weight or even obiste because they had time to go out and exercis or play sports with othes. Exercising is importent because espeshaly when as a teen you are over weight or even obiste well theis problems just don't go away this will cost you in the futer because not only do you have to chance of getting deobetice but you also have to pay for all the medications and treatments that comes with it. Experts also belives that by spending time on the computer will tack time away from enjoing the things that nature has to offer. When other might argue to it is a good thing for people to learn about the different types of place's in the world. Well I delive why do you have to just read about the places online and look of the picture why can't you be the one tacking the pictures for other to see. And why can't you be the one experincing it insted of just reading about it. Experts also believe that by spending time on the computer it is tacking away time from you being able to interacting with family members and friends. Well as a teen myself I have learned that by intercating with family and friends are vary important to our health. I am not the only person that agrees with that because study shows that kid that can talk to their perents and have good convercations with their parent have the ability to do well in school and have more respect towed others verces the the kid or teen that can't really have conversation or talk to their parents. For example if you are the type of person that talk to your family You will have good grades such as A's and @CAPS1's and will learn to have respect for other and the person that can't talk to their parents have troble concentrating or even macking troble fro themselfs and getting @CAPS2's and @CAPS3's.

15447,6,"In theory, the idea of creating a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building was a great idea. However in reality, it didn't turn out so well. There are many reasons why a dirgible could not be docked to the Empire State Building. For example: ""Most dirgibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of Helium"" (paragraph @NUM1) This was dangerous because hydrogen is extremely flammable, and if for some reason an accident occurred, it could be catastrophic over a densely populated city like New York. Possibly the most dangerous obstacle was the climate around the Empire State Building. There is a constant powerful wind that shifts a lot due to all the different air currents the building creates. If a dirigible docked there, it would be blowing all over the place, if it could even dock at all. Most dirigibles that were moored in open fields were weighted down with lead weights in the back, but this would be too dangerous to try over a city teeming with people. Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""

From the very beginning of it's construction, the mooring mast was not properly thought out and did not have the proper design. Al Smith realized this even before he finalized the process of building. Once he finally did complete the mooring mast, he faced obstacles. The dirigibles had problems with docking, due to the wind and the elements, the dirigibles had a hard time staying stationary once docked. Another obstacle was fuel, due to the recent Hindenburg crash, dirigibles needed to be fueled with helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen. Finally, the laws that were in place about airships not being allowed to fly low over urban areas caused the mooring mast to fail. Eventually airplanes took the dirigibles position and the mooring mast was retired. Due to these obstacles, Al Smith gave up with the mooring mast but still helped the record for the highest building.",3,3,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I searched the whole library for the book then finally decided to ask for help, the privilage to read the book has been taking away. The book was no longer allowed in elementry schools, due to the fact parents were seeing what their children were reading and found the book very offensive. After many reports about the book, the book was taken out of the library. For me to do as my teacher asked i had to go to a public library and get the book.        If you find a book offensive keep @CAPS3 to yourself and dont read the book, they shouldnt be able to remove books just because of what people think of them. Many people love different types of books, no matter if they are offensive or not others @MONTH1 like them.         I believe that everyone has a right to read anything they want, books are made to be read and looked at. If books are being taking away then very less books will be read. But the more books read and understood, more books will be wrote and published.          The same has to do with music, movies, magazines, ect, they all are made for a reason and should be checked out. @CAPS3 is great to learn about different things by reading, listening, reveiwing, ect, even the things people @MONTH1 find offensive, they @MONTH1 teach lessons.",3,4,,3,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4078,2,"I do not believe that censorship in libraries is a good thing. For many reasons but to save sometime here are just a few of the reasons why I believe this, there would be no books left for anyone to read, if certain books where taken off the shelf we would not have the knowledge from them, and our kids would not know what other people can think of. At the end of this essay one might understand the advandages and disadvantages to censorship in libraries. @CAPS6 many books would be gone?     If we all took off one book that we found offensive then our children and other children would not be able to read. Taking off one offensive book per person leaves no books left in a library. What one person @MONTH1 find offensive another person could find rather enjoyable. Some of my friends think that '@CAPS1' is an offensive novel but I found the book to be rather enjoyable. On the other hand we also have to understand that there are somethings that just shouldn't be put out in public. @CAPS6 would we get as much knowledge as we have?     Without all the books that are in our libraries @CAPS6 would people get the knowledge to make great discoveries in science, history, and electronics? People would be lost if we didn't have our books. The books give people great knowledge and a great place to learn @CAPS6 to do things. I myself have learned @CAPS6 to become a successful @CAPS2 novel @CAPS3 from the @CAPS4 I took out of 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4 for @CAPS5.' @CAPS6 would the ideas of other people be heard around the world without books in our libraries?     Those books that are offensive can also be of great use when doing a research paper or just trying to find something to talk about with friends at school or work. Without the books that we have in the library people would not be able to understand what other people thought about certain ideas on politics and other issues in daily life. The books help people come up with ideas to create things and be createative in everything they do. The ideas that one person expresses in their writing is a great place to find a spark of imagination when a person needs something to keep their mind off of personal issues. Life without books?     Censorship is a good and bad thing in libraries, I myself on one hand do not find it appropraite but on the other hand it can be taken to a whole different perspective. People who want to use it don't understand that other people could take the books off the shelf that they, themselves like to read in their spare time, nor do they understand all the knowledge that we gain from books even if they are fiction, and lastly without the books that we have no one would know what someone in a different park of the world was thinking. Foremost people who want cenorship in libraries don't understand what would happen if we had the power to all take one book off the shelf. One could understand both sides of the coin here but we need to step back and think about what life would be like without our books.",4,4,,4,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ofcourse you @MONTH1 meet a friend like this and it @MONTH1 happen when you least expect it. I didnt expect a new friendship but in a new town and with new people i met the friend i now call bestfriend.  It was the year of @NUM1 and i was new to @ORGANIZATION1.

My homeroom teacher @PERSON2 @CAPS1 me my so called schedule. Sixth period, @CAPS2 class with @PERSON1. What? @CAPS2, what is that. I really had no idea what a @CAPS2 was until i walked into that class. I turned the rusty knob of the door to the gym where my class was supposed to be. I walked in and well there I found out what a @CAPS2 was. It was a one wheeled bike. Wow! I laughed thinking how did i not know that.  I looked around and saw that i was the only sixth grader around. I took a seat and looked everywhere trying to figure out if i was really the only sixth grader there, when in walked a girl that looked about my age. She took a seat and i wondered if she was nice so i could go talk to her, but i was to emberrassed to. @PERSON1 asked everyone to get in groups of two and i asked the girl if she wanted to be my partner. We started to useb the unicycles and our partner had to help us get on and ride until we could ride with no help. Class was over and i tolde her my name was @PERSON3 and she told me her name was @CAPS3. I was super excited to go to class next time because i now actually had a ""friend"" well atleast someone i talked to. I went into the class and she was absent so I was a loner that period. I had to be partners with this other girl named savannah witch was a total girly girl. She didnt want to ride the @CAPS2, all she wanted to was talk. I was sick and tired of her by the end of the day and I had'nt practiced my unicycleing.  I was really hoping @CAPS3 would show up to class the next day, and she showed up. This time we had to get with our partner and make a routine to a song that we wanted so we were pretty stoked. We started practicing and trying to come up with something when suddenly we both fall. We stared at eachother and just started laughing and laughing i couldnt breath and she almost peed. It was one of the best times i had experianced that year, and i felt like me and her could become the best of friends.  We are now really close friends and just that one moment of laughter together brought us close at heart. We love to laugh we believe that the more you laugh the younger you look and well i think its true. everyone has their own story about how they met a certain person and how they became so close. I believe that in every friendship what braught it together was a smile or laughter. A laughing moment where you laughed so hard you farted and milk came out of your friends nose. Its a great time and you never forget it, its something that is so simple but so special and it really marks your heart and the way you feel around that person. It braught my friendship with a person i had barley met into a friendship that is now insepreable and amazing. ",19,17,,36,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,

Most people go the the library to study or use the computers... But what about the other people?     I went to the library and saw racest books most adults would find that offensive especially if its an afracan american. The thing is that people would also go there and check the books out to sutdy about the old times it's not there to offend people. Some books are very infromational and people need to study and learn about the past so that it doesnt happen again.     Another peroblem most people have is with the adult books parents defantly dont want their children looking or checking thoughs books out. But when noone stops them from checking the books out there really is not anything you can do about it. I believe that libraries should have an age limit for checking out certen books.     The last thing is the music it has bad language in it and kid can just check them out with out even trying hard. Most parants the to sheild their kids so they will be good and not use dirty language but when the and go to a comunity plase and just listen to anything that causes a peopblem. Personially I think that it gives the library a bad name and therefore that get little business.     You know that if you were a parent you really wouldn't want your kids grabbing racest, adult books, and music and you would like for the government to take some the books and music out of the library. I believe that their should be a vote to see if we could have thoughs books amd music removed or atleast put in an adult section in the back.      My main point of this essay is that they either need to have voting for what goes into the library or they need to start censioring the books and @CAPS1's they put in the library and make accessalble to the comunity.

Therefore, there should be a wide variety of these things on the shelfs so people can do what they enjoy best.     Books and magazines @MONTH1 be offensive, but they @MONTH1 also entice the reader. i personally love books about drugs, sex, and many other inappropriate things. In fact my favorite book is banned from my school library. If they took all inappropriate books out of they library. What would i read? not everything can be just peachy kin all the time. Its not in real life, so why should we have to read a little fantasy world that we know isnt true? I know i would'nt want to read that.      Just like books and magazines, every one has their own taste in music. some like country, classical, metal, and maybe even rock. If you took the songs that were offensive off the shelf that would make people angry. That's like not playing a song on the radio thats offensive, and many songs played on the radio are degradeing to women. if it can be played on the radio. Why cant it be in a library? there going to be able to listen to that song on the radio anyway.     Most movies these days are very gory or offensive in many aspects. Many people are interested in these movies. If you can watch that movie in a movie theatre, why cant you check it out of a library? Some people go to check out movies that are shown in school so they can watch it if they were absent. What would they do if that movie got taken off the shelf? Fail? I know i would become angry if that would happen to me.     Keep offensive books, music, movies, and magazines on the library shelfs.

This is a warm mood because when you think of a kitchen you think of a warm room with sweet eromahs of delicious food in the oven.A reason why it is a nice mood is because all of the cultures got along and treated each other like family. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM2, ""All of theus cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" It is nice because there was alot of racism at that time and all the cultures overcame it together.The last reason why there is a warm and nice mood is how he apreciates what his parents have done.

4038,2,"There are too many people in the world to just have one opinion about one topic and nothing else. If a person knows something is unjust, they obviously have to tell the world about it, or they feel like their opinion does not matter. Take, for example, women's clothing. If you show a man a piece of women's clothing on a computer screen, he will probably only have one or two opinions about that piece of clothing. If you show a woman that same piece of clothing, she will have more than two opinions about the piece of clothing. This is how society works today and it is not just because we were brought up that way; this is how we think and how we act.     @ORGANIZATION1 depicts beautiful as half dressed and makup put on like plaster. Many magazines and books, such as @CAPS1 and books about modeling, portray beautiful as stick thin and your clothes almost falling off your body. Many songs and movies tell you that being beautiful is on the outside. If you can find these magazines, books, and movies at your local bookstore, don't you think that they could possibly be two miles down the road at your local @CAPS2 library?      Libraries aren't just for adults and teenagers. They are intended for people of all ages. Many people do not realize this, but at many libraries, there are sections specified for teenagers. Young adult books and magazines should not even be put in the teenager section, only for the reason that there are subjects in many of the young adult books that a lot of teenagers have not even begun to dicuss yet. If these books and magazines are put in here for teenagers, do you not think a five year old child could wander up to the section, take out a magazine and wonder how the women in the advertisements grew up to be so beautiful? Like I said before, @ORGANIZATION1 depicts people to look beautiful, when it's all photo-shopped.      If a five year old child can get their hands on books and magazines that they shouldn't even know about, @CAPS3 would a library keep them on their shelves. The thoughts that the five year old child has now is '@CAPS3 am I not that beautiful?' @CAPS4 image is the key to how people view society today. Modeling agencies, photographers, and even cheerleading coaches make girls feel like they are worthless because they are 'too fat', 'too ugly', or 'too short' to be part of what they have wanted to be in their entire lives. Many women that @CAPS8 starve themselves every day just to maintain the 'healthy weight' which is @NUM1 pounds and you can see every rib in her body.      Many books, magazines, and television shows portray this as well. You can find them in libraries nation-wide. The magazine, @CAPS1, has articles about how to become skinny. The television show, @LOCATION1's @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8, shows people that being tall and as skinny as a stick is the way to go. Many workout books tell you that being like @PERSON1 is the 'best for your bod' way to be. You cannot tell a girl that she needs to be a specific height and a specific weight by a specific time. Woman don't work that way. No one does.      Many magazines, books, movies, and music tell you this, and it is not true. I believe that if libraries took these types of materials out of their facilities, then if would drop the rate of society's '@CAPS4 image' rapidly. Many woman and girls wouldn't feel like they are ugly or fat. They would love who they were and they would not believe what another person says about them or what they look like. Being beautiful is not just on the outside. Anyone can have a beautiful heart and that will shine through more than anything else.",4,4,,4,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I remember when I was sad, I would go and talk to my friend @PERSON2. I went to him because we could talk about why I was feeling that way. Then after a while we would be laughing - being happy. Laughter brought me closer to my friend. We were able to understand each other. We have been friends since we were in elementary. Because of laughter in our relationship and memories of days when we laughed, it has made this relationship last. I have been mad at my friend and he has been mad at me.

Out of nowhere @PERSON2's little nephew starts dancing and laughing while doing it. @PERSON1 gets up and does the same. @PERSON2 then gets up too- it was something I didn't expect to happen. They chose a certain song and made a dance for it. The whole time this was happening we were all having a good time. They all looked funny doing their dance. After a while @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 got tired. But we kept on laughing because @PERSON2's nephew kept on dancing. They danced to this song a few other times that @DATE1. It was still funny to me the last time as it was the first time they did it. Laughter connected my friendship many other times. This one though, is the one I mostly remember because it was funny. I remember it like if it was just last week. Being happy in a relationship makes it last a long time. That is why I think laughter is important and it does really make any relationship stronger.

1201,1,"Dear editor, Computers are becoming more and more prevalent in the @LOCATION1. Peolple are spending too much time on computers instead of on other activities, an effect not beneficial to society. Because of computers, people have lacked exercise, missed enjoying nature and other parts of the world and forgotten about interacting with family and friends. Computers should be used in moderation and not in place of other important events in our lives. First of all, computer users receive significantly less exercise than those who do not use computers. According to a survey done by the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 only @PERCENT1 of computer users reported that they exercised at least once every week. In contrast, @PERCENT2 of non-computer users (non-frequent computer users) reported that they exrcised at least once every week. Can one imagine what it would be like if everyone was a loyal computer user? Nearly everybody would be overweight, lethaigic from lack of sleep due to hours on the computer, and unworldly. Getting exercise is an essential part of everyone's life, and lacking it could be deleterious to one's health. Hopping off the computer and instead getting exercise, would make for a healthier and more fit country. Not only do computers deprive people of getting exercise, but they also prevent people from enjoying nature and other parts of the world. By traveling to @CAPS1 and unfamiliar places in the world, one is able to experience and learn about other cultures. Going on the internet @MONTH1 be a decent way to learn about other places, but actually feeling the ambiance and environment of a foreign place is allows for a much more profound understanding of another place. For example. when I went to @LOCATION2 for a vacation, I learned about the differences in traditions and culture. I saw the separation between the poor and the rich when I lookes from humble sharks along the river to the portentous, eregant edifices scraping the sky. It was an experince I could not encounter on a computer. People should be able to enjoy the wonders and differences of the world not on a small screen of a computer, but through the screen of one's eyes. Lastly, computers inhibit people from interacting with family and friends. From my personal experiences, I tend to ignore friends and family. Speaking, playing, and generally socializing with others is a critical part of everyone's life. Without this basic necessity people cannot be happy. In summary, computers should not be used in excess. This sort of use could read to people getting less exercise, not fully experiencing the world, and closs of interaction with friends and family. To make a better country and nation, the people of the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 should make an effort to reduce computer use.",6,6,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It might ben their parents, grandma, grandpa, aunts, uncles or it might ben one of their best friends. Some people also might be on their bank acount. To see if they can get out money fror the bank.

4222,2,"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I disagree with Katherine Paterson's statement because there is a @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 and the @CAPS1 to Write. The author obviously had a purpose to write the novel, compose the music, or to deliver the movie. There will always be items that will be offensive to some people, but to others there is a meaning behind it.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 gives everyone the right to speak what is on their mind. That @CAPS1 allows them to publish whatever they have to say in a novel, a piece of music, or in a movie. Sure there @MONTH1 be some parts that @MONTH1 be inappropriate somewhere in a novel, piece of music, or a movie, but that doesn't mean the whole item will be inappropriate. Some people might think some things can be offensive while others don't at all. There maybe somethings out there in this world that you @MONTH1 think are offensive, but have you stood up and told that company yourself?      Being able to put down anything on paper that you want everyone to know about is the @CAPS1 to write. With that you can't be told not to do so. For example, the '@CAPS6' magazine maybe offensive to an abundent number of parents who don't want their kids to look at it, but that magazine isn't intended for children to look at. That magazine's purpose is to show adults what is all out there to buy to make their appearance sexy. It's not to be offensive to anyone and that company has the @CAPS1 of write to publish such a thing. The @CAPS1 to write serves its own purpose to all of the writers, composers, directors, and anyone who wants to write in a journal or to write a note.      I bet there has been a novel, a piece of music, or a movie that you just love. Well within it there most likely was a piece of information that was inappropriate, but would you like to see that taken off of the shelf? For example, I once read a series when I was in middle school that had inappropriate content about sexual interaction, but that series is what every girl wanted to read. If they would have taken them off the shelf because they were not appropriate then I know plenty more novels that would be gone as well.         What would you say if there was nothing left on the shelves to read, listen to, or to watch? Without items such as books we could have a hard time learning new stuff all the time. These are the items that teach us new things everyday. Would you be able to enjoy your life without being able to read, watching movies or @CAPS7 shows, or listening to music? It would be a very hard thing to get used to in today's society. We rely on such things @NUM1 to get us through the day and teach us things we were never taught.     Disagreeing with the quote that Katherine Paterson stated is one way to use @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 by stating my view of removing inappropriate items off of shelves. Removing items of the shelves won't solve the proplem of having too much inappropriate usage in today's society. If everything that had some kind of inapporpriate content in it removed from shelves, we would have a hard time finding a novel to read, music to listen to, a magazine to enjoy, and a movie or @CAPS7 show to watch. Lots of schools rely of books to read and without a book childrens vocabulary could have a great downfall.

330,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that there is a big discussion going on about if computers have a possitive effect on people. I believe that computers do not have a possitive effect on people because children on the computers are not safe, they are spending too much time on the computer, and the programs and internet for the computer cost too much money. First, computers have a negative effect on people, including chicken, because computers are not safe. With all this @ORGANIZATION1 technology, child predators can go onto facebook or another website and find out everything about you. This has happend to many people. Some predator went onto my friend @PERSON2's facebook page and found out his birthday, where he lived, and what school he went to. Thiss guy sent @PERSON2 a threat saying that something going to happen to him. Luckily, with the help of police, they were able to find this guy and arrest him before he got to @PERSON2. These days, this is happening all the time. More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 give all of their information away about it on these websites and child predators have looked at them. @PERSON1 states that ""@CAPS1 this @ORGANIZATION1 technology has helped, but the negativity if has had on society but @DR1 the good the computer is doing."" @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want @CAPS3 to get taken by these child predators who know everything they need to know because of the computer? Another reason why computers have had a negative effect on people is because @CAPS3 are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time doing homework and exercising outside. These @ORGANIZATION1 websites that gives @CAPS3 the ability to talk with friends and play games have made @CAPS3 lazy and addicted to the computer. My friend, when he was little, would play outside for hours and hours at a time. He would play all different kinds of sports with his neighbor. Now @PERSON3 is older and all he does is sit on the computer until his parents have to force him off of the computer for dinner time. @PERSON3's grades have dropped tremendously and he has gotten very chubby compared to what he used to look like. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT2 of @CAPS3 have gained weight due to not exercising and their grades have dropped @NUM1 on @NUM2 grading scale. Dr. @DR1 Much says that, ""@CAPS3 have forgotten the fun in playing outside and lost the determination they had to do well in school. This is all because of these @ORGANIZATION1 computers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 now can go to any website do anything on that website."" @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want your @CAPS3 to gain weight and stop doing well in school?

These @ORGANIZATION1 computers are crazy expensive. They range from @MONEY3@NUM3 for a @CAPS4 computer. Then each family had to buy the software and programs to go with the computer.

1446,1,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people think that computers educate people for the future but I think that they actually harm children and adults as well. First of all, kids are so wraped up in computer games that they never go out and exercise. Second, if you ask a child anything about nature they will probably not know what to say, but they would if they spent less time on the computer. Finally, many families today never see each other because kids and their parents are too busy on the computer. These three reasons show why computers don't benefit society. Obesity is a huge problem among the children in @LOCATION1. The reason for this is that they are spending too much time online and not outdoors and exercising. Kids are not getting any fresh air or exercise and this can lead to serious health conditions. Parents sometimes don't do anything about it because they they have the same problem. This just shows that computers and other technology are effecting families around the country by making them overweight and. @CAPS1 children don't know the first thing about nature and. People say that computers educate people about things but nature and the environments is a big of our lives. The best learn about it and help. Computers the time they are, the earth might become even worse so they need to get educated on nature and the environment so they can. I know from my own experience that computers take away time from your friends and family. Instead of playing games on the computer at home, you could be spending time with your family in the park or the pool. My dad always spend his time on the computer and we never had time to spend with him. When he realized this he rearanged his schedual so we could have more time together. It is very important to spend time with your family because they are such a big part of your life and less of computer will help families do that. As you can see, getting off the computer will help kids stay in shape and healthy, educate them on the enviornment, and help families interact with each other more. If getting off the computer changed my families lifestyle then it will do the same to others as well. Hopefully you agree with me because it will surely tak a positive affect.

20916,8," Laughter is like feeling your alive, that nothing else matters, the pain in your life releasing, and the feeling that everything is alright. You laugh when things are funny and sometimes even laugh when they aren't funny maybe to make someone feel better or just to relax a little. When someone tells you a joke and its hilarious do you just sit and stare at them, or do you fall on the ground laughing? Personally I fall on the ground laughing hysterically. You can have the best of times when your laughing it lightens the mood a little, makes it less tense in the environment. I have enjoyed many times by laughing at the silly things we do or at the dumbest things we do and make them not as bad by laughing about it. My friend and I have been going on adventures since the third grade. We go on walks and get lost, we built forts in the middle of nowhere, we road her quad out to the sandy race tracks, and we climbed over fences to pass the time. Every little adventure we went on came back with a laugh and a huge story to tell are friends and family. After all these adventures and growing up you seem to lose interest but you never forget the good times you have. Let me tell you about a good time I had laughing so hard I even started crying. When your little you think things are a @CAPS1 more challenging @CAPS3 they really are, or things are a @CAPS1 more taller @CAPS3 they really are but that didn't stop me. When @PERSON1 and I were about @NUM1 years old we loved playing outside, climbing the trees, burying old treasures to find when we grew up, and spying on the neighbors. Well on this particular day @PERSON1 and I chose to ""spy"" on the neighbors. We enjoyed doing this cause they had kids, animals, and tons of cars so they were outside A @CAPS1. @PERSON1's dad had about ten tires just laying right next to their fence so usually we would stand on them plus on are toes just to peek over, but this time we felt that would be to obvious we needed to be more sneaky, more like a spike, and more secretive. Eventually @PERSON1's dad left to work and he stays gone for quite some time so we had things to prepare for. We thought of every possible way to look over the fence from drilling a hole to sitting on top of the shed. Finally after time to think about it we had the perfect idea to climb on the trash can and sit down and spy on them. Being brave as I was I volunteered to go first to make sure it would work so that after I was done @ORGANIZATION1 could try. Don't climb on trash cans next to a wooden fence, things don't turn out like you would of expected. As I got on top of the trash can it starts to shake and I was afraid so I held on to the top of the fence but the problem with that is I pushed the trash can further away from me causing it to tip over and me to hold on to the fence leaving me with the worst scraped hands I have ever seen. After the wild adventure we had I needed something to cool down my hands fast cause they were burning. So we had the idea to look in her dads shop van through the first aid kit but well we were in there I noticed a small fan hanging next to the radio so I turned it on and placed my hands in front of it for a good half hour. @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 and I started talking about what had happened I thought about everything and couldn't stop laughing it made me cry because I was laughing so hard. Without laughter @PERSON1 and I wouldn't have the friendship we have today.  Laughing is the main source for friendship I feel. All the adventures @PERSON1 and I share, well they wouldn't be the same without laughing at it afterward. You can look back at things and be like, ""@CAPS2 that really sucked."" Or you can look at things and be like, ""That is hilarious."" @CAPS3 laugh tell you cry. I could see laughter being the shortest distance between two people because it helps make things less awkward, helps you realize your mistakes and joke about them, and it helps you be you without having to pretend your someone else. If friendships were based without laughter I don't know if they would be as good, well at least I know some of them for sure wouldn't be the same.",20,17,,37,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,

First of all just learning how to use the computer is a skill you need in life. At most jobs you have to know how to work a computer. Today computers are essential part of most work enviornment. Hand-eye coordination is another skill the computer teaches you. Computers actually help you with sports in a way. To catch a ball you need hand-eye coordination. The technology the computer gives us helps us alot in life. If you need directions you can look it up on the computer. If you couldn't you would have to call the resturant for directions. Without the computers help we would all have to write all of our papers out. For students it would be a nightmare to have to do reports without a computer. We would have to read so many books to get the information. The world would be a much different place without computers. Sometimes people who we love have to move far away from us.

15578,6,"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" a historical article by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it is made clear that there were at least three obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. These issues were the building's pre-existing frame, fire safety, and nature itself. The plans for the Empire State Building had not intended a mooring mast to be dropped on the roof of the building. As a result, architects had to change their entire plan: ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" (par. @NUM1). This was a significant difficulty. Also a concern for foreign dirigibles was that the gas the use made fire safety and issue: ""... the owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area,"" (par. @NUM2). Getting around the fire hazard would be impossible. Finally, as stated in the article, nature was the mast's greatest obstacle. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" (par. @NUM3). The violent winds kept much from happening with the mast. With the three aforementioned obstacles, the fate of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was grim. It would never do what Al Smith had intended for it.",3,3,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16124,6,"Al Smith's plan to add two hundred and fifty feet of height onto the Empire State Building by attaching a resting stop for traveling blimps was plaussible in theory, but as it was put in motion the workers had to face multiple obstacles that ultimately made the attempt unsuccessful. The easiest and the only fixable obstacle was the issue of the added stress the blimp put on the building's frame. The whole building had to be strengthed to adjust to the pressure, but the workers eventually got the construction done. However, the biggest thing that hindered the mooring mast from being successful was nature itself. The winds that high in the air were constantly shifting violently, so even if the dirigible had been attached to the mast, the back of it would swivel around uncontrollably. Unfortunately because they would have landed high in the air, using lead weights the control the back of the aircraft was impractical. The prevention of natures problems is not possible, and similarly nothing could have been done to fix the issue of unsafety. Most blimps outside of the @LOCATION2 used a more flammable gas inside of them, and landing a dirigible that could catch on fire high above New York City was an extremely dangerous idea. There was nothing the workers could have done to solve other countrie's blimp composition. Finally, if nothing else, there were solid laws that made it illegal to ever have anything tied up so low over and urban area. Obviously, this obstacle couldn't have been overcome without waiting years and a lot of legal business. Placing the mooring mast on the Empire State Building with hope to land dirigibles seemed good, but during the actual process many obstacles were presented, most of which had no solution. In the end, the hope to ""equipp [the building] for an age of transportation,"" had to be given up.",4,4,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

21592,8," We all understand the benefits of laughter. Laughter is definitely the most important part of my best friends and I relationship. Without laughter, we couldn't possibly have as much fun together as we do. If I am having a bad day, I can always count on my best friend to make me crack up, and forget about the day I have had. If we are out and about, or just relaxing at home, my best friend and I are always laughing. The end result is usually us both with tear streaked faces from laughing so hard. There are actually quite a few different instances in which I remember laughing particularity hard. This last @CAPS1 @CAPS2's eve for example, it started snowing at around three a.m, so my best friend and I ran outside screaming at the top of our lungs. Snowballs started coming from every direction. During a game of hide and go seek, we decided to bury ourselves in a snow covered leaf pile. Within ten minutes, our legs were freezing. So what did we do? We put on our swim suits and jumped into the bath tub together. Having her there to laugh with me, made the situation a lot better.  Another situation in which I remember being particularly funny, was the entire third trimester of freshman @CAPS2. I needed a first period class and the only thing open was intro to manufacturing. I definitely was not looking forward to it, until I found out that my best friend had it with me. We made a bad situation a lot better by laughing at every single stupid mistake we made. Since we are not exactly experienced in the field of metal, there were quite a few mistakes. With out my best friend there to laugh with me, I have no idea what I would have done. I believe that whenever I am in a bad situation, laughter will always help me. One last situation in which laughter helped a lot, is when I used it to cheer up my best friend. A couple of days ago, my friend had, had a really bad day. Things just weren't going her way. After school I could tell something was wrong. I tried talking to her about it, but that wasn't really helping. So, I brought up some of our past experiences together. Within a few minutes she was laughing and I could tell she felt a lot better. Laughter really does help us out of some tough situations. Laughter is by far the most important factor in my best friends and I relationship. Our relationship is mainly based on laughter. Without it, we just wouldn't be as close as we are today. If we need it to cheer each other up, or cure boredom, I know that laughter will always be on our side.

16004,6,"Although the problems with docking a dirigible were not considered in the beginning, the builders of the Empire State building faced these obstacles eventually. Their ""greatest reason was one of safety"" for the passengers and pedestrians below in the city. Many countries ""used hydrogen rather than helium"" in their dirigibles, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could have caused several problems in the future. A German dirigible called Hindenburg was destroyed in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 because of fire, and it was after that incident that the owners of the Empire State building realized that an accident like that could not take place ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" because too many people could be injured. Even though safety was a large problem, ""the greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" when a dirigible was ""tethered to the mooring mast,"" the violent air currents at the top of the building would cause the ""back of the ship [to] swivel around and around."" The air currents not only made it hard to hold the dirigible steady, it made it extremely challenging to even reach the mooring mast. The idea of using lead weights to hold down the end of the blimps was not used because dangleing weights above @CAPS2 ""was neither practical nor safe."" one last obstacles the builders faced was the existing ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented any dirigibles from being tied to or even approach the building. However, two blimbs (Los Angeles from U.S. Navy and the @LOCATION4 from Goodyear) did try to reach the building but were stopped due to the wind speeds. The several obstacles that presented themselves to the builders of the Empire State Building prevented the mooring mast from being used for the future of transportation.",4,4,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

21109,8,"  Laughter is a important part of my life.The best way to pass the time is laughing with friends and family. Think back on all the fun times you've had, if you do you'll find that most of them you are laughing. That's because laughter and fun go hand in hand. Everyone likes to have fun, therefor everyone likes to laugh. Laughing is good for you in many ways, it keeps you happy, helps maintain healthy relationships with others, and it relieves stress.  Also a lot of people laugh when there nervous, I'm one of these people. Especially when you're put in a awkward situation. Like when you have to do a speech in front of the class. I remember my first speech in high school, it's one of the scariest things I've done. It was @CAPS1 year and I slouched down in my chair and tried to get as low as possible so the teacher couldn't see me. I wouldn't make any eye contact with her either. I put my back pack in front of me in order to block her view. Every time she'd look around the room to pick another person to go I'd hold my breath and hope it wasn't me. Every time it wasn't me I would breath out in relief.  Finally it was getting down to a few people and I knew my doom would soon await me. I decided to take a chance and peek over my back pack to see who the teacher was looking at for her next victim. What I saw when I looked at her was her eyes meet mine. I tried to hind behind my back pack again but it was to late. She had already started to call my name out.  What should I do? I thought to myself. Should I tell her I'm not ready? Should I try to get out of it? I wiped my sweaty palms on my blue jeans.Then I stood up and started to walk toward the front of the room. I could feel a nervous knot building up in my stomach. With note card in hand, I began to speak. My words were quiet and shaky. My speech was about uniforms in school and if I agreed with them or not. As I went on I could feel myself start to trip over my words. Then I started to laugh, which I always do when I'm nervous. I could hear other people in the room start to snicker. I smiled and looked down at my note card and continued my speech. After wards I felt a big relief to get it over with. It wasn't perfect but laughing at myself when I messed up helped me get through it without falling apart from my nervous.  Although not everyone reacts this way, laughing can help relieve tension in some situations.But always be careful not to laugh in situations were it's not appropriate. It's not good for you to have constant stress. Finding things to laugh about can be a good way to relieve stress. Laughing might not be the right behavior to get a A on your speech but it did help me keep it together to make it through. Laughter is important to everyone. It's a good way to have fun with others and it keeps you happy. Laughing is a good way to relieve stress. Your relationships will grow stronger if you find things in common to laugh about. If you learn to laugh you're sure to have a fun and happy life, I know I do. ",20,20,,40,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,

3537,2,"Censorship in Libraries               Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 are many books, magazines, and movies out @CAPS1 that contain content not necessarily appropriate for young children. Part of a parent's job is to ensure their children are safe and looking at materials appropriate for their age level. However, this does not mean taking materials off of library shelves for everyone.

Censoring the content on the shelves of libraries @MONTH1 be a good idea for children, however adults have the right to choose what they want to take from the shelf. Would you like to have a portion of your freedom taken away? Censorship would greatly lower the freedom of everyone and their individuality.     Furthermore, censoring what is on the shelves of libraries limits the range of materials that are available to patrons. @CAPS1 is content out @CAPS1 that children should not see; however adults have the right to choose what they want to read and come in contact with.

21214,8,"The Benefits of Laughter Laughter has always been a major part of my life. Most of the relationships that I have with my friends are great , because i can make them laugh and cheer them up when they feel down. When a person laughs it makes them completely forget about anything that brought them down, and now they just focus on what made them laugh and feel that joy and happiness. When you laugh , the only thing on your mind is the thing that made you laugh, nothing else. laughter in many cases has brought people from an absolute low self-esteem to a high self-esteem in a very short amount of time. An example in where laughter was very beneficial to a person happened with one of my friends. One of my good friends seemed to be really down and didn't want to talk about what was going on with anyone. With him not telling anyone what was wrong it kind of leaves you guessing, what could have happened? After about a week of pretty much isolating himself from others, he was ready to talk and hang out with some of his close friends, which included me. Me, and two other people that were friends with me and him, decided to go golfing which was a new hobby of ours. It was that day that he told us how his mom was cheating on his dad for over a year, and how she was also hiding alcohol in all different kinds of places. and was over-drinking.  By him just being around his friends, laughing and having a good time, he found himself focusing on other things other than what was going wrong in his life. Even laughing at yourself can be a good way of coping with your problems. even when there seems that nothing will go right in your life, something always will, you just have to give it time.
