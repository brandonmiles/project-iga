3769,2,"My views are that if it is offensive to someone or other people the certain maeterial shouldn't be taken off the shelf. I think you should have to have permission from a parent, or guardian if the material is explicit. For example in a store where you buy cd's, games ect... you have to be of age to buy the material that should be the same with books.          Say a book has a certain word on it like '@CAPS1' it shouldnt be taken off the shelf just because of its name. That brings up the subject don't judge a book by its cover. Just because the name isn't to someones standards it shouldn't matter. Pick the book up read the back and see what it's actualy about. Then if it's what you was exspecting it to be talk to someone who is in charge, and explain top them what the problem is in your case.     Also you could always have a section of the store, or librarie just for adults only. It @MONTH1 sound stupid, but it can actualy help out alot. There is tons of books out there that have things in them not appropriate for children. Such as love books, they talk about love, and passion in ways that are very innappropriate for children.      If there was a section of a store or librarie it could help keep these things out of your children, or other childrens minds. You or anyone else wouldnt have to worry about children picking certain material up that you wouldn't want them to see. Just keep this in mind next time your in a librarie and you see something you wouldn't like for your children to see",3,3,,3,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID3,ORG2,STY3"

3548,2,"Do I believe that vertain materials should be removed from the shelves of libraries if found offensive? I believe that all types of materials should be placed in libraries to satisfy the different styles of what people like. Censorship should not play a role because everyone has their own opinions on what is looked at as offensive and what is not. By giving everyone the freedom to enjoy what they like will make alot of people happier.      The wants and needs of people varie from one extreme to the other. What one person loves, another @MONTH1 hate. This should not play a role in whether or not materials should be removed from public places such as a library. Everyone has the right to express themselves through art in their own way. Taking away the art that some find offensive would not be fair to those who enjoy it. By doing this, not all people will be satisfied when not everyone gets what they want.     Censorship should not take part in any library. Entertainment can not always please everyone. It will be judged in many ways no matter what anyone has to say, so the problem should just be left alone. Arguing to take away the material that some like will only cause tension to rise and make matters worse. It is understandable, for example, that a parent would not want their child to be able to be welcomed into the media world where not everything has postive influences. That's life though and not everyone has th same outlook on it. You have to think of others, and respect their view of it all as well.     Opinons will vary with what I have had to say. I strongly believe that people should be given the right to enjoy the materials they take an interest in. Censorship definitely has its positives and negatives, but for the most part it is wrong and should not have a role in any library. Cutting down people's availability to their interests will only lead to frustration. You can not please everyone, so in that case, censorship will just have to be looked beyond.",3,3,,3,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID2,ORG2,STY2"

4122,2,"Should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive?     I do not think that certain materials should be removed for many reasons. Many different people have many different thoughts on whats offensive and what isn't like some people will find something funny that some people @MONTH1 think is nasty or inapropiate. If you was to take things off the shelves that someone found offensive there probably wouldn't be much left on the shelves because everybody has they're own oppenion. I agree that certain things shouldn't be seen by young eyes but thats the parents decision, not everyone has the same view on the material.

4761,2,Offensive things should be taken off for many reason that will be explained later on. Things in magazines shoud be appropriate for people to see. The first reason why they should be removed from the shelves is it might be offending to someone important like the president of the @ORGANIZATION1 or the @CAPS1 of your state.      If the subjects in the reading material are offensive to someone they should say something to defend themselves. If they don't speak up no one will think to change anything.     What I don't understand is why people would let that ridiculous stuff be put in the magazines and music and movies anyway.Even though movies are kind of different. Movies are mostly just made up ideas that people come up with. So if people are offended it is just pretend to begin with.      Offending things in books well the author probably has a reason for it. It might be something that is offending yet people need to know this in case it has to do with someone you know.For example in the Newspaper I read an article about our current president. @PERSON1 was being question about his birth certificate. People did not believe that he was born in @LOCATION1.      I personally think he was in fact born in the @CAPS2.S . But of course they did see his certificate that proved he was a member so that mess should be dropped and forgotton. It was uncalled for to begin with.     I wonder what was going through his head when someone asked him that question. I'm sure someone would have seen it before he even became president.,3,3,,3,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID1,ORG2,STY2"

453,1,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that computers have positive and negative effects on people. In the past their have been more negative effects on people. In a survey taken in @CAPS2 magazines @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT1 of people, have negative effects with computers. Inmy opinion, I think comuters have a negative effect on people. First, people are not interacting with family and friends. @CAPS1 is very important to have interactions with people. When on the computer your not really interacting with. You just sit there staring at a screen. In a survey taken at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and not interacting with the people around them. Parents don't se etheir kids as much because they are always on the computer. Parents would love to see their kids move. Interacting with their family and friends will be healthy to them. Computers take the away fromhanging out with family and friend. Secondly, people don't get to enjoy nature. People on computer might go outside because they are involved with the computer. Stay in one room doing the thing for books for a @CAPS5 in a while people need fresh air. too but learning about nature is more nature. If you dont enjoy nature you dont know what is going on.NAture is all around us and why would you miss out on. in a survey taken in a local magazine @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and. While people enjoy computer, nature. Lastly, people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising. Exercise is important for the mind and body. Our bodies need to stay healthy and fit. The lack of exercise is increasing fast. The more people get computers the people exercise. America is over weight already to join the People on computers most just long to become over weight. People rather play on computer that got exercise for a healthy body. Dr. @DR1 a local doctor, has seen more people become over weight and not exercise as much as they used to. He says computers do not provide exercise. He recommends that people use their computers less computers are doing more. In conclusion, I think computer negative effect on.

647,1,"Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benifit the society. Computers help use in many ways but the @NUM1 main reasons are they help us store important documents get better at or learn forein language and get information. So without further adue here is more extensive reasonings. First of all, computers help us store many documents without computers companies that involve autioning and many other thing would have to store everything in filing cabinets. That would take forever and there wouldn't be enough room, so a lot of files would @CAPS1 be laying around every where @CAPS1 think about it. You use computers to make store send your newpaper articles and without computers you wouldn't be able to keep everybody up to date. Secondly they help use learn on get better at forien languages. Computers help use learn what other people are saying in other countries around the world. Like I have grandmother she the learned spanish. Now I can talk to her and she can understand me. Finally computers help use get information. They help us get information for a project at school, records direction, etc. In the year @DATE1 people din't have computers but when the first router was made the people I went up @NUM2 points. Farmers became slaves became very rich and I kid even grad collage at age @NUM3. So before you say people are spending too much fine on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends think about what computers do for us @CAPS1 think.

My father never turned on a computer in his life and his buisness is doing fine. My father and his father has all of their records in a safe. One of my fathers friends had everything on his computer. When a virus hit it all of his files were gone and along with his records. My father handwrites all of his papers. He says if i need to type something out i'll buy a type writer. Also on things like facebook someone can see everything that another is doing. This is were alot of people pose as someone eles and thus @CAPS2 people get kidnapped or killed. A very good reason is that when people have alot of personal information when a virus hitls that person knows everything about you that you put on. For exampel i was watching a show on discovery channel when a man hacked into a myspace acount and used that persons name to people and try to create a cyder to the pentagon, that person almost got caught but never was.

Not every one agrees that computer are benefitsal for the society. The positive effect and negative effect that computers have on people. My resson for supporting this @CAPS1 that computer are good or bad are that computers have a positive effect on people. The second @CAPS1 is to be able to talk to other people on line. The last @CAPS1 I have is Spending more time with family than on the computer. The first resson that i have for computers is how they have for computers is how they have positive effect on people. The examples that I have to Support this @CAPS1 are that computers tech hand eye coordination, computers given people the ability to Learn about far way place and peop. The second resson that I have on computers is that you talk to people online. The examples that I have to support my @CAPS1 are the website that kids us to talk to their friends like myspace and facebook. The place that kid like to go to are tutube and even blogging about everything and everyone. Some of theis thing can be good if you don't post picture or other this on your myspace or facebook. I think that these website are dangers because somebody can hack in to your file and they can try to talk to you like their your friend. The third resson I have to support my @CAPS1 is that we should spend more time with our family than being on the computer the whole time I have example on want we should do with or familys instead of being on the computers I have some @CAPS1 of games that we can play with our familys instead of being on the computers, The games that we can play with our familys are monopoly, somy, canda landy card, video games, we can also talk to our family instead of talking to our friends the whole time.

4514,2,"Should books be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Who would determine if something is offensive or not and to whom it offends? These are just two questions that can create a high level of conflict and issues among many people. Would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view?      First of all, who decides what is offensive and who it offends? It is possible for anything to offend anyone.  Also removing a book from the shelves could be offensive to the writter and the followers of the writter. Bringing up removing a book from shelves could cause more problems then just letting the book remain on the shelves. If offending others is the issue then would it not be better to leave it alone over all, rather than making it an issue to please one group but inturn upsetting another?      Secondly, could removing a book from the shelves limit your ability to learn something or hear something from another point of view? If books that offended people would have always been removed for reasons of offending other we could not have much of the knowledge we have today. For example a biology book might be offensive to people whos religion explains things differently and would make things untrue, and a religous document such as 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3' could be offensive to the people who believe the biology books to be true. If we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive, we would not have religion or modern science. This example could be used for any topic or genre of book because people can take many different things as offensive.      As a solution,  I believe it true that it is not possible to please everyone. If one person is pleased another is offended. If that person is pleased then the first person is offended. If books could possibly labeled as'some might take offensive' or 'material @MONTH1 be offensive' then people have a warning and they can choose if they want to read it or not. If they are offended they can not put blame on the author or where ever they got the book because there was a warning. It would  be just like the parental warnings on cd's. This @MONTH1 not fix the problem of people being offended, but it could very much reduce the amount of complaints about a book being offensive.     In conclusion, books should just be left on the shelves regardless of people complaining about them being offensive. Books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning. That is just not an opition. Leaving books that offend certain people on the shelves @MONTH1 cause contraversy with others but if some sort of warning could be put in place and the proper procedures are preformed, the issues should decrease greatly.

People in library fight over a sigle book. I think who ever gets there first should get the book, but that just me. If two people fight over a book they should be kicked out of the library and never come back to the library. And that is why we have fights over a book. The next time you are in a library think frist before you act. Ask yourself '@CAPS3 they get ther before me?'.          The library should have more that one copy of a book. Lets say '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1' book sreies is in the library and thay have one of each book. Now the lat move of '@ORGANIZATION1' is coming out this @DATE2 (@DATE1) and people what the last book to read. The kids what it, but there is one book. So what do you do? Get more copies of the book. This is why libraries should have more than one copy.          If the libraries don't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums. If they have one copy of a book it will begin fights. You don't what to fight in a library (look @CAPS4 @NUM1). Now if it was me, I will let someone have it that whan it.

I think that the only restriction that should be made is the age limit on naughty adult books or novels and if they are very bad then they should be behind the desk and you have to be of age to get it.      My conclusion is, if you are going to look at all kinds of books they should have no restrictions on what you look at. You should be of age for romance novels and darougatory books but for the library they should have tons of books and magazines with no restrictions",4,4,,4,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID2,ORG2,STY2"

4033,2,"As @CAPS1, we are entitled to both freedom of speech and freedom of the press.  However, these rights are somewhat suppressed in the censorship of media at libraries.     I can understand why libraries feel that they need to ban certain works; there are many children that frequent libraries, and having explicit content could deter parents from allowing them to visit.  Surely, though, the media in question could be placed in a seperate area, off-limits to anyone under a certain age.  Even if someone gets their hands on one of these works, safeguards could be used at the front desk to keep them from borrowing the material.  Their library card would show their age, and the worker would not allow them to check out the work if they were too young.     Furthermore, I trust in people's common sense.  If they believe that a book or movie will be too adult for them, they will avoid checking it out of the library.  Parents, as well, will surely not allow their children to borrow risque material.  Information is open to those that search for it, and the knowledge it brings prevents unwanted results.     There are those that want this content banned because it does not conform to their morals, but this is really just setting restrictions on other's freedoms.  They @MONTH1 think it is too explicit, but another @MONTH1 not.  That other person might want to use the material, but because of restrictions set by the first person, the borrowing of the work becomes prohibited.  It seems that if the first doesn't agree with the material, they could just let it be, and not bring others into the dispute.  People know their limits and generally make sure they don't cross them.     I think this conflict represents the @CAPS2 way of life in itself.  When a disagreement arises, no matter what the topic, one group of people wants to basically control what everyone else can or cannot do.  They organize protests, sign petitions, etc. True, people do protest laws, and with good reason.  However, there really is no need to argue over petty issues that could easily be avoided if people were to just use common sense to reach a consensus.  I think this censorship issue is a prime example of that.     When it comes to these kinds of debates, we need to learn that we can't be too quick to place restrictions; that we should leave others to do what they think is best for themselves.  The best course of action is to leave others alone concerning simple things such as this, and to avoid placing any restrictions on anyone's works, rights, and freedom.  To paraphrase @ORGANIZATION1, I @MONTH1 not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death your right to say it.",5,5,,5,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID3,ORG3,STY3"

3470,2,"Censorship in Libraries.                                                                           Censorship is a big conflict in many libraries. @CAPS2 are plenty of offensive books that shouldn't be put on the shelves.  Many schools call these books, magazines, and movies, '@CAPS1.'  @CAPS2 is often a week where people read all of the books that have been @CAPS1 from school libraries.  I participate in this school wide challenge beacause I disagree with banning books.  Banning books can be good and also very hurtful in many reasons.     First off, I like to think of banning books or anything else from the author or writers view.  How would you feel if you spent around @NUM1 years writing this story/movie for kids that got @CAPS1 in the first couple of weeks it was on the shelves.  I don't think that many people would enjoy that.  I also think that many people don't think of authors at that big of a deal.  When I think of that it makes me think of all the things we couldn't read in our world. Including, newspapers, books, and magizines.  Maybe even include the fact that it takes a lot of work to write the things on what people want to hear, or see.  I feel like when books or movies get @CAPS1 or removed, it makes the author feel like they're worth nothing.  The parents point of view makes things a lot worse.      Think of it this way, your child comes home from school with this book that he/she wants you to read with him.  You sit down and start reading, when suddenly you come across a violent or inappropriate secne in the story.  You stop reading all of a sudden and look at your child who is enjoying this violence and loving this story!  What do you do?             Many parents would call the school and explain what happened and complain about banning this book and taking it away from children that could get this book.  Taking it away has no point because just banning it from the school library doesn't mean that they can't find it elsewhere.  How do you think your child would feel having loved this story now it's gone?  I know that it would make me feel like I did something wrong.  Taking things off shelves also has a good side to it.      When you take the book, movie or magizine off the shelf it is gone forever from that library.  This can be a good thing because then kids won't have the obvious reason to get the story.  If you don't want your child or other children to see it then it is quite a good idea.  It makes the @CAPS1 object harder to find and also harder for the kids to grab intrest to.  If the book or movie isn't around then they won't want to read the next one or see the next movie. @CAPS2 are many different views on censorship, which could effect how people choose what happens in libraries.     My view on this topic was negitive and I support that fully.  If the author works hard on writing the story they shouldn't get punished for expressing their feelings in a story. Many different poeple come across this issue and @CAPS2 are many different views on the topic.  Next @CAPS1 book week I'll be supporting the authors that got crushed by their work getting @CAPS1.

Another obstacle was an already existing law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building.

""cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This quote made me visualize the scene, and I felt happy to think about the beautiful and enjoyable setting. Secondly, it made me feel loving to my loved ones like my family and friends. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance,..."" I love my family, and would be thankful if they tried to take their home country to the United States (if they were born somewhere else) with them.

""@CAPS7 I didn't this time."" @CAPS4 was telling the truth. There are times when I cheat by distracting him during a game, @CAPS7 I won fair and square. ""@CAPS3're just mad because @CAPS3 lost. Get over yourself and take @CAPS14 like a man."" That's all I had to say to make him throw down his controller and make him run upstairs crying. ""@CAPS6! What did @CAPS3 do to your brother?"" @CAPS11 mom yelled. ""@CAPS4 beat him at a game and now @CAPS4's mad."" I knew @CAPS4 would do that. @CAPS17 and report me to @CAPS11 mom hoping that she would save him and get me in trouble. ""@CAPS13 @CAPS14's just a game. @CAPS3 can't win every time.""

4101,2,"Throughout history there have been many books written at a time in history when their beliefs on certain things differed from what our world today believes. Things that have changed as our world has changed are the views on slavery, womens rights, religion, and many other things. These views are based on what most people of a time frame believed. I feel that just because something someone wrote or said offends someone, does not give people the right to ban that book or quote from society as a whole. They have the right to ban it from themselves, but it is up to each individual whether or not it is banned for everyone.      Our government gives us the right to have freedom of speech. This shows that even though someone @MONTH1 write or speak out against the majority opinion, they can say whatever they want without being punished for it. This means that people can not just ban something for what it might say or portray. In my life explicit music seems to be something that some people are trying to ban. My parents believe that I am at the right age that I should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music I want to.      I feel that public libraries can set age restrictions on items based off language, nudity, and other inappropriate things for children just as movie theaters do, but they do not have the right to ban books. Even though there is an age restriction, as long as the guardian of the child direct says it is fine if his/her child @MONTH1 check out the book or the parent checks out the book for the child, then it is fine that that child gets that book. The choice for what is appropriate for that each child should be left up to their parents.      If libraries had to ban books because someone said that a certain book or magazine was offensive, then a library would have very few to no books. In almost all of books someone @MONTH1 be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else. These books that offend people should be kept on the shelf so that people can understand how society's views on things were back in the time period that the book was written. These items in libraries that are found offensive shows us what was wrong with society at that time and helps us learn from past mistakes in history and how to avoid them. For example, in the play A @ORGANIZATION1 it shows how the society's view of women was. It showed that they did not think highly of women and how there purpose in life were to raise the children and that was it. They did not feel that they had the intellect to talk about science or anything like that. This indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today.       If libraries start to ban books, music, movies, magazines or other items then they are hiding things they do not want people to read. Libraries should not be able to ban something because it is offensive, but they have the right to put age restrictions on certain things. Authors and artists have freedom of speech to say whatever they want and libraries can not take that away from them",4,4,,4,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID3,ORG3,STY2"

Good, because people start to read better after reading a lot, and bad because a lot of people dislike to read.     I think that when you go in a library there should be impropet books for people to read. Children go in library's, what if they pick up a bad book and form horriable habits? Children, and adults have very different views on what to read. Kids want to read fairytale stories, etc. Adult's on otherhand enjoy mystery storys about murder, and such.     Yes, library's can let people check out any book they find interesting; But, what if that book is bad for there children to see lying around. It's simple if you make sure you don't leave your books just lying anywhere, kid's wouldn't form bad habits, or discover anything there not suppose to know. Kid's are noises, and they will try to read your books, or see something bad on a magizine.     In library's, there is the children's section, and the adult section. That helps in some way's, but your child can still find that bad book, etc at home. Parents can keep from this for the safety of there childrens thought's, or qeustions about that certain book, etc that they found. It's good to just put thing's away when your done, and keep every bad book, etc out of your childs react.     Books are bad, and good. You can find the information you need, or something you really don't want to read about, or see. Books have stuff that we sometime's need to know, and want to know more about. If your kid finds a misleading book, make sure they didn't read it, or look at it; and just hide it away from them.

1665,1,"Dear @CAPS1, Advances in computer technology have positively affected the society we live in today. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help kids learn inside and outside of school, and connect the world socially. These amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation. In fact, they have done quite the opposite. Computers are an excellent way of teaching hand-eye coordination. People who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant. This is not the case. The coordination gained from using the mouse games over to sports like baseball and lacross. Players have to look at an incoming ball, and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball. As you can see, coordination is essential to sports. It is also needed for simple every day tasks around the house. These could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals. We overlook the fact they easy jobs like these still require coordination. A misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess. W are lucky that we live in a world with such a good teacher of hand-ey coordination. Computers are the worlds most knowledgeable teachers. No matter how hard you try if you are using a computer, you will learn something. The internet is a best cache of information. In the current day and age, the environment is a growing concern. Paper no made from trees, so must be cut down. It takes forty years for a tree to grow, and seconds to cut one down. Schools everywhere should use computer and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil. Since most students are familiar with computers, they enjoy working with them more than writing. The average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would whole day at school. The transiton needs to be made. Computers are also a massive social network. Instant messaging and @CAPS2 are now primary sources of communication. If it hasn't for computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friend that moved to @LOCATION2 two years ago. This is just one example of how social networks are helpful. They help people stay connected with old friends, and work. All major corporations use computers to invest, sell products, and store information. Computers are the ultimate way communicate. Obviously, computers are growing exponentially in popularity. The @LOCATION1 should put this to use. Imagine a more eco-friendly country where we don't have to cut down a million acres of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 rainforest every year. The benifits of computers are endless. Three of these are hand-eye coordination, knowledge and communication.",4,5,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID2,ORG1,STY2"

While the blank screen of a computer @MONTH1 distract some, the benefits defin out weigh the bads in a situation like this. Being able to have faster research, easier communicating and computers in wartime are great capabilitys of the modern computer. Also, due to advancement in technology, computers are very helpful because they help @LOCATION4 with our daily lifes. Many doubts about the computer exist, but the computer can surpass all of them. In a time crunch situation like college or high school, speed is everything. Computers allow students to research faster, and with more accuracy by being able to search for key words. Before, students would have to do the painstaking process of searching in books. More times than not, they wouldn't find what they were looking for, but with the modern age, students can get the information they need fast. Also, having computers in the classroom helps so that teachers can get the info they need for an upcoming class. If speed is what you need, then you will look for a computer. Besides speed, computers also give you another great thing, communication. With emails, @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and blogs, knowing what your friends are doing later is just a click away! This is much easier than calling the person. Also having this access to friends can help when one moves away. If you miss a long lost friend or cousin, just search their name, and you can talk to them! Having friends so close by you can really make every life great.

However this in not the @DATE1, women are not looked down upon anymore, science is not dillouted, and ideas are free throughout the world with the internet. So is it the libraries fault for providing uncensored content or is the parents fault, for not educating their children on the morality of such items?     The modern library has very specific demographics for all items to which it posses. Movies over @CAPS2 attract both parents and teenagers alike, the music entices the teenagers, and the books and prior two media sources attract younger children. So how would it be fair to force a library to censor two of the things that earn the library the most money just so that kids don't read,watch or hear them. Plus libraries generally don't let young kids check out @CAPS3 rated movies or parental advisory @CAPS4.     Some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults. As books can raise ideas and strengthen them in a teens mind over the course of @NUM1 pages till parents end up with an anti-sematic teen with bad view on racism. So then why would that be the fault of the library as it merely provided one book that should not have affected that teen so much, had that teen had solid moral beliefs instilled in him or her from their parents.     So if you find materials at a library offensive, or worry about your child going there, there's always an easy solution. Don't go their and don't let your child go their. However if you see the beauty in impurity that a library brings to a community and to a person as I do then don't allow the injustice to authors, songwriters, musicians, directors, and yourself occur.",4,4,,4,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID3,ORG2,STY3"
3247,2,"Do you believe that certain materials in the library should be removed off the shelf if found offensive?     I believe certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some of my reasoning is very logical and if you were a reader I'm sure you want to read something thats true and very interesting. Libraries all consist of books from everything you can think of. Libraries are really for learning and not to offense anybody in any manner.     The reason why I believe they should not be removed because everybody is equal and not everybody likes to read the same books. There should be offensive books because I think that theres just to many kids that would not like to grab a book and it be orginal and not offensive about them in some way. Books are created to read and have interest, laughter, enjoying. From some of the students at my school I spoke with said that when they are really having a bad day they turn on their music and it helps them because it makes them feel alot better and the day gets easier for them. They say they dont have to be depressed or thinking about something that made them mad that day.     Well as in from my experience with books I can tell you somethings and sometimes that when I was feeling down how I grabed a book. The first time I realized books are really helpful and I'm also talkling about magazines, music and movies. Well to be honest I'm not a big reader. I enjoy listening to music because sometimes songs can relate to you and make you fell  that your not alone. Also it helps you learn how to cope with some things that you could of never coped with before because it makes you feel relaxed. Just how some of my friends said that they feel relaxed when they read a book.     So my point is that you know and I know that their are music out there that is very offensive and some books that are.  Does it drive us crazy that they do? No it does not because it actually helps us. It helps us by showing us away out from our daily streesful lifes and sometimes you learn in books and songs of how other people deal with their stress. So you learn alot of things than feel offensive about books or music. As you can tell I'm a huge music fan and there has been lots of songs that were offensive but it did not bug me much.         I hope I gave you some kind of shock that music and books should'nt be removed if offensive. It's just music is amazing as well for books we all need our space sometimes and those two things are just there for us which is either to help us learn or feel relaxed and calm. Thank you for reading this and I hope I persuaded you enough with my reasoning. Remember music and books are alot alot of fun and if you never gave it a chance, you should try it sometime.

430,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers and other technology are the best thing that ever happened to the world! I hear that computers effect people, well I don’t agree with that statement. Here are my @NUM1 reasons why. Computers and other technology make the way easier. Talking to family and friends without spending money. If you control the amount of time you use on a computer then you will be fine. Please keep reading to hear my great ideas. To start off, computers and other technology make life easier. Think about it we have access to our bank accounts, stores, reasearch, school, etc. See instead of having to go at shoppingfor food you could just order it online with no trouble. We can now shop @CAPS4 cloths and other household items. It'so easy just to look at a list and pick what you want instead of waiting in a long line. @CAPS4 example, I went to @CAPS1 to pick up a few items @CAPS4 a party. There a long line, so I just got online picked what i wanted and had it shipped to me unless then @NUM2 hours! Its cool to not have to even got up to get what you want. I know you sometimes have your since you don't wanna get up? But you have to go shopping. Doesn't computers make life so easy. Secondly, talk to family and friends without having to spend money. This is awesome because you can text, video chat, email @CAPS4 free. Computers have so many websites to talk to your family and friends like, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, myspace, yahoo, and even ohvoo. Mostly, all those you can video chat and voice chat @CAPS4 free. All of those sites you can text @CAPS4 free and touch those with your @CAPS4 example, one day I didn't want spend my to talk to my friend. So I just video chatted with them. And it was @NUM3 times better and free and better. Even @CAPS4 people long distanceis way to much money in call them. So why not just video chat I know you wouldn't wanna spend hundreds of dollars @CAPS4 a phone call bill! Please keep reading. Thirdly, if you count he amount of time you use on he computer of other technology devices then you will be fine. If you limit and set a time on the use of your computer everything will be wonderful. You can tell your body to get off the pc and get a work out or talk to friends. There's no way you could be addicted to something if you have a limited @CAPS4 it. If your the type of person that is a at something. Then @MONTH1 be you shouldn't get a computer. Like my mom gives me a limited @CAPS4 the computer @NUM4 my laptop has to be off on a school night. An @NUM3:00pm my laptop has to be off on the weekends. There's alway ways to not to be addicted. You just have to know when enough is enough. Its not the computers fault. Just have to control yourself. To wrap this up I would just like to say thank you @CAPS4 having the time to read my letter. My reasons are, computers make life easier, talk to family and friends @CAPS4 free, and if you control the amount of time you use on a computer than you will be fine. Thanks again.",4,4,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID2,ORG1,STY3"

3666,2,"Going to the library you would think of it as an family environment, wouldn't you? I know that when I think of the library I do not think or offenceive material that would make anyone upset. Surprisingly many of the libraries do and I do not think that they should be alouded to, since it is not aimed just for adults.     Children loved to go to the library to check out books and many more things that they  enjoy, but a five year old does not need to see a movie, a book, or anything else for that matter descrimanting against the other gender or another race. These materials should not be able to sit apon the shelves no matter what the writers say if they are putting someone down. The writers or the library owners wouldn't let there own children read it so why should it be okay for someone else child to read or watch it.  I'm not the only one who thinks this, I am sure that there are millions of people like me that would not appericiate their loved ones finding these things and reading them.        The information that young ones see or hear while they are still young will carry on with them throughout their life; who knows what they will do or think when there are old enough. Theses places are supposed to be an family place where you can go to get information not for someone to pick up on violence, drugs, racistism, and any other diragotori subjects. Young kids are not the only ones that should not be reading these cruptied material; teenagers and adults are more likely to understand it better and take the subjects into account.     I am begging these library owners to please take these offensive materials out of their branches; not only because small children could see them, but adults does not need to be reading, listening, or watching these things either.

All of a sudden the world and its people have become dependent on information that computers provide. The variety of data bases and resources the increased communication and the skills computers allow you to portray and prove that they are essential for this generation. Communication over computers benefit now society can interact between one another. Personally I have been able to talk and see my family who live overseas through the advanced technology on computers. Different communication programs include @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and e-mail, the most commonly used cite.

Paretns and teenagers these days have become very lazy in comparison to the way they used to behave. They are nit interested in going to the library in order to research information on people, places, and family heritage. Computers have been a huge convenience in a persons life by allowing all the information that was once in books to be contained throughout the internet. For example if you are doing a project for school. the internet will provide you with any information you need. It is truely astonishing how much one electronic instrument can impact and influence a life. Being a student, I am commonly curious about what references teachers are making and additional information that is not provided. The internet allows any person in possesion of a computer to research what they have wondered about and to give a response on the subject almost immediately the benefits of computers can practically cover the few negative effects as it is a way to let a person discover various information on any desired subject. Besides searching for information, computers can be used to document data of your own. Microsoft has invented several applications of which allow you to graph information design presentations, and neatly record drafts of writing. No person is flawless and is incapable of mistakes. Microsoft helps take your exentuated imperfections and hide them by doing things as little as making a neater copy of your essay, or putting your lists of data into graph form to make it more eye-friendly to viewers. Society has become reliant to sources scattered throughout the date bases on computers and by directly looking at the negative effects that a computer can have on aperson and therefore putting restrictions on this information source will enable society to have to positive donations that computers these days have on our way of life.",5,5,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID3,ORG3,STY3"

People have made beter connections with family and friends, and even have the ability to make new ones. While social networks are great and all, computers can also make work extremely easy and proffesional-looking. They can also perfect the skill of hand-eye coordination. But with that in mind, is the computer truly a harmful or helpful device? Sometimes we wonder where our long lost friends and relatives have gone and how they are. Well, with the computer and internet access, you can easily contact them through great social networks such as @CAPS1. I hear it all the time from everyone that reunions have been made, and friends have been reunited. And reuniting friends, you can also make new ones with a simple click of a button. Isn't making more friends and reconnecting so easy now? Computers nowadays offer wonderful software from @ORGANIZATION2 that can make making slideshows, projects, and reports far easier. I remember making a @CAPS2 with my best friend back when we were in @NUM1 grade. All we did was take the pictures, upload them to his laptop, and then we added captions to all of the pictures. We did an amazing, professional job on the project and received an A-. Though I understand that in the process of computer-usage, people hardly find time outdoors, the technological advance will enhance hand-eye coordination. Imagine this: You're up at bat in a baseball game. @NUM2 strikes and @NUM3 balls is your count. Everyone is cheering you on. The pitcher pitches the ball and wham! You swing that bat and hit yourself a homerun! Do you know what skill was used to hit that ball? That's right - hand-eye coordination. So now while everyone is wondering what sort of effect the computer has, remember how easy that work was for me. Also think back to that baseball player. You know, the one that hit the homerun using hand-eye coordination. But most importantly remember how easy it would be to contact the ones you love most and keep closest to you.
