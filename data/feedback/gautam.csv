First, many of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen gas rather than helium and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 following the German dirigle Hindenburg, Empire State Building owners ""realize how much worse the accident could have been,"" and this resulted in the decision not to utilize the mast as a docking area. Also, when Al Smith decided to build the additional mooring mast onto the top of the building, due to the weight of the docking blimps, the architects had to invest ""over @MONEY1"" to modify the building's framework and enable it to support the weight of a dangling blimp @CAPS2, due to violent winds, the docking dirigibles could not properly land and ""were constantly shifting."" Lead weights couldn't be used because of the dangers and impracticalities the idea could set on the @LOCATION1 below. Finally, it seems that the overall safety and practicality of the mooring mast weren't easily attainable. Al Smith states himself that the engineers are ""trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement. Hence, the builders of the Empire State experienced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building.",4,3,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

640,1,"Dear, I strongly believe that computers are great. There are a-lot of great things you can do on the computers. A-lot of people are saying that computers have bad effects on people, like not getting enough exercise and spending time with your family. I do not agree with that because say you have family in a different town, city, or state. There is a website where you can webcam people from all over world with anybody, so that is a good opportunity and also it is free and you can do it at anytime and if you have a laptop, anywhere! My next reason is that you get to see places you have never seen before with direct pictures, like on commercials when our familly wants to go on vaction to a far place and you know nothing about it. You can go on the computer and look up the place and see what it is about and also see what other people said about. Like if it is really hot, or cold, is it a good experience for kids, anything you want, the computer has it. My last reason on why computers are good is because of studying, one thing that always happens is I leave my textbook home. I can go on the computer and see what we had to do. Also you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject. Survey’s shows that @PERCENT1 of the kids who study on the computer pass there test and get a higher grade percentage +@NUM1. Also if a kid is studying and dosent know what a word is they can I look it up and figure out the definition and how to use it in a sentence.

The greatest obstacle builders faced was nature. ""The winds of the top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also the back of the ships would force the dirigible to spin around from the forceful winds. Then using lead weights in the Empire State Building, they would be dangling high above people on the streets below and it is not safe.      The next obstacle is that a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made dirigibles illegal to fly over to the building.",2,2,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
611,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have @NUM1 reasons why computers effects have on people. First, computers are not good for your eyes. Second, the reason why people get on computers a lot. Third, there are so much games and places to go like myspace, facebook and even twitter and much more. Keep on reading so I could tell you all about my three reasons. First of all, computers are not good for your eyes because computers are like @CAPS3's is the something but not really because computer as more information and @CAPS3 dont really got so much information you could browse for. My second reason is that the more people be on computers the more blind they could get just for being on the computers for a hour or more. Third, some people dont even dare if they be on ocmputer they wont they might think that just becaus ethey wear gasses they wont get blinder but they are wrong they will get more blinder. As you reading you will find out my second reason fro being to much in the computer. My second reason, is that why people get in computers alot well peopel get on computers just to their or do their taxes but that is not good because just because your doing your bills or your taxes you  to alot of information that people in other countries or state could get without you knowing , second is that people or get on computers to pay their bills or do their taxes they also get on the computer to maybe order something or buy a ticket to fly to a place they want to go like a vacation place or a business trip. my third reason is that they not only buy or order things but thet get in websites that will make their lives better like meeting soembody special or something else. As you keep reading you will find out my third reason for being to much and so long in the computers. My third reason, is that their are alot of activities to do in the computer for a example myspace, facebook and twitter are the most popular website that people get in just to meet new people and talk to old friends. In conclusion, people should not be on computer too much because of their health and their privacy and also to be sure not to meet strange people. ",4,5,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16303,6,"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York, annanced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet. At the time it would be the world's tallest building, but the builders faced obstacles with the more distinctive part; allowing dirigibles to dock there. First, it would be difficult to build a suitable landing area. As described in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, a dirigible held by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. Therefore, the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened so that the added stress would be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Also, safety is a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM2, it stated that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders came to realize that if one of the dirigibles were to catch fire, like the German Hindenburg in New Jersey, it would cause huge problems due to the fact that New York is densely populated. Lastly, nature itself is an obstacle for the builders. The winds on top of the building are constantly shifting do to violent air current. As described in paragraph @NUM3, the back of the ship would swivle around and the lead weights would be dangerous for the pedestrians down below. Overall, the construction of the mast was difficult, and unfortunately is never to be used.",3,4,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A dirigible would only be held by one cable.The dirigible's load and the wind presure would have to be transmitted all the way down the building. There were also safety problems. A lot of dirigibles used hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable. It is also very windy around the Empire State Building. The dirigibles would have to hang sandbags by ropes. These would hang above the people below. The mooring mast was a good idea, but the builders faced to many problems. The project was never completed.",3,3,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1053,1,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1 and I believe that computers have a negative influence on people. When people are on computers all day they have less time exercising. They are in alot more danger, and they spend less time with there family. These are my only some reasons why computers dontbenefit society.. In more, more time spent on computers equals less time exercising. With the obesity rate rising no one wants to be unable to do regular activitys. With spending all your time on the computer, you would just be using to get over weight and unhealthy. It also makes many people feel self consiou about themselves. If they dont have enough time exercising and keep eating they will become even more self consious. More over it will bring more danger to you and your family.

If you spend more time on the computer then you will increase your chances by @PERCENT3 to get a personal assuts, or even give you personal information up. So why should you take the risk? Just get off that computer! Even if you dont meet on internet assuter you will still be glued to your computer cauzing it more likley to be harrased. I definatly dont want that for my family.

21490,8,"  Laughter saved my life. Growing up, my life was pretty normal. Me, my little brother, mom, and dad, all living happily together in a nice suburban area. But two years ago, everything changed; and it seemed as though it wasn't for the better. My parents got a divorce. It was all very strange because at that time in my life I thought that that couldn't happen to me; it was impossible. As I talked to my friends and family about it, I learned to live with the fact that my family would never be the same again. But thought I came to grips with my new life, I still was unhappy a lot of the time. But the times when I was with my best friends and caring family, were the times that I forgot about all of the things going on at home.  George and I have been really close friends since the @NUM1 grade. We are inseparable. Though I have many other friends, he is the one I would always turn to if there's a problem. He knows me better than anybody else. We talk every day at school, we text message each other every night, and hang out almost every weekend. The night that my parents told me they were getting a divorce I called him crying. He told me that in the end it would all be okay, and he told me that he was always there for me if I needed anything. At that point in time it was clear to me that I had something that not a lot of people can say they had in their lifetime: A true friend who would be there through anything with me. He and I would joke about all my problems. To some, that @MONTH1 seem a little strange; but it was almost therapeutic to me. Making fun of my life, made it easier to live it in a sense. It helped me to realize that I need to let go of the past, and that just because there's a rough patch, doesn't mean that the rest of my life is destined to be this way. George knew how to cheer me up, and he could always tell when I needed a good talk, or a good laugh to make my day better.  A girl always needs another girl in her life to tell secrets, to do crazy things, and to lay on the couch all day watching sappy love movies with. For me, its @CAPS1. When we're together there is no stopping us. She was always right by my side through my parents divorce. She was there with me, my last night in my house before we moved out. We sat on my bed in my empty room, recalling all the memories the house had given us. Some would think this would be a sad time, but all we did was laugh. Because all of the memories were good ones.We weren't crying because we were upset; we were crying from laughing about all of our insane adventures for hours. To me, that's a pretty good reason to cry.We re-lived our best moments that night, and we weren't going to let the situation make us upset. We wanted to make our last memory in my house a good one; that we would always remember.  My family is quite strange; but we do know how to have a good time. I don't have many family members, but I think that because we are so tightly knit, we get along really well. Whether we're out in the backyard playing a game of wiffle ball, or in the house playing pranks with whoopie cushions, it's always a fun time at my @CAPS2 @PERSON1's house. During the rough times of the divorce, I would spend a lot of time at my @CAPS2's house because I didn't have to worry about being questioned all the time about how I was feeling; I just had to worry about if I should bring sneakers to go on a hike, or if I should bring my pajamas in case we decided to have a movie night sleepover. That house is a place I still go to just relax, and forget about whatever @MONTH1 be worrying me. @CAPS2 @PERSON1's is a safe haven for me to just let go, and have a good time with some of my favorite people in the world; my family.  If I didn't have all these important people in my life, I don't know what would have become of me. As I grow up, I'm realizing that these people have molded the person I am today. They helped me through the roughest time in my life, and that proves how much they really care about me. Some say laughter is the best medicine; I say it's love. Laughing helps to get you through terrible times, but the people who make you laugh are really what matter most.

Another way to have fun and enjoy your relationship and friends at the same time is to have a time and maybe go to the movies with all your friends and boyfriend and go watch a movie or go to the fair were ever you think you want to go but also think about your friends and boyfriend if @CAPS6 are going to have fun there or if @CAPS6 will get bored. When you go with them make sure you make them laugh at least so @CAPS6 know that you are having fun make up a joke but don't say a joke that will make them fall asleep like my little sister @CAPS4 told us a joke it goes like this (guy on the @NUM3 I speak to your dad?"" the little boy whisper and said ""@CAPS2 busy!"",""@CAPS3 about your mom?"" said the man on the phone, @CAPS5 the kid said ""@CAPS4 is busy too!"" @CAPS5 the man asked him ""@CAPS5 @CAPS3 are @CAPS6 doing?"" and the boy says""@CAPS6 are looking for me!"" we didn't get it at first @CAPS5 my sister told us that the boy was hiding from @CAPS2 parents because he took the phone with him as in the boy don't tell jokes like does make it more funner. and thats why we need laughter in our life's.

Some things can be really offensive to elementary school students but not so much to high school students, it would just depend on what they are reading, watching, and hearing.      I've never experienced anything offensive in what i've read in any book before but I have experienced some in music i've heard. I didn't say really anything about it I just thought someone shouldn't have written this certain song that I was listening to and I didn't think it would really be that bad.

3320,2,"There is a certain amount of responsibility when it comes to censoring all the different types of media and literature. Deciding whose responsibility that is can be a difficult task. Children can be strongly influenced by all media out there and making that material has been made easily accessible. When someone comes of age to make decisions that affect their life then they should be able to. Shop owners should be able to sell whatever they want in order to make a living.     When children go to a library usually they will not do so alone. Parents can decide what their child is allowed to take home or not. When a child comes to their parent with a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive or inappropriate it comes to the parent to decide whether or not they want their child to be exposed to that material. If the parent allowed for their child to have access to offensive media then that can give the child the idea that what they are looking at or reading is alright.      If someone has come of age and has all the other freedoms that everyone else has they should be allowed to buy, read, and watch what they want. To prove to someone that you are of age to have access to offensive material you should have to show some sort of identification proving it.      A shop owner or businessman/woman should be able to sell whatever he or she wants to in order to make a living as long as it stays within the boundaries of the law. Having someone who does not work in the law or a person who is not a legal guardian or parent of someone who is not of age should not tell someone not to buy, read, or watch something just because it might be offensive or offend that one person.     I conclude that in order for a someone to tell another person not to buy or rent material that person would either have to be law enforcement or their legal guardian as long as they are not of age. There is no reason why people should not be able to access material that is not against the law. If someone is offended by some literature then they should try to make it against the law.",4,4,,4,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21394,8,"  I believe that laughter is a healthy way to get a along with someone, and have fun! I think that the more you laugh the more fun you're having with someone or a group of people. One time me and my friend @PERSON1 were hanging out at my house and we literally couldn't stop laughing, every little thing was hilarious to us for some reason! It makes us have so much more fun together, when we can just laugh together instead of fighting. I love to laugh; all my friends call me obnoxious because I laugh all the time. I feel like if you're laughing and laughing with someone it makes you closer and it's way more healthier and better if you just laugh! For example I always want to hang out with @PERSON1 because we always laugh together and have a good time. It's like when you have a group of friends and some of them you always disagree on something or fighting, its never fun. If you have a boyfriend/girlfriend and you always laugh with her/him it just makes you want to be around them so much more, because your having a good time. Fighting just does the opposite!   I've recently realized who my good friends and who are my bad friends. Laughing is the biggest quality to have in someone. The girls I fight with are usually the ones who have no personality and are very negative and are just mad people. My friends that I do get along with we always laugh and have a good time, the only time I've got in a fight with one of my good friends is because the downers always say random stuff that's not true and hurtful so that person will be right there down with you! I have realized the more you laugh the more fun you will have and the more people want to be around you! I've also noticed that my mom and dad are completely different people. My mom is a sweetheart who always laughs and I can always have fun with. My dad on the other hand never laughs. I honestly can not remember the last time I heard him laugh. He is such a downer and no one ever wants to be around him. That's probably why my parents are divorced! You can just tell that my mom has more fun and my dad doesn't. In life you really just have to have fun do what your supposed to do and laugh. So really what I'm trying to say is laughing is a important part of any relationship; whether its with friends family dating, just anything! It's definitely a good quality to have.    If a person is always happy and always wanting to have a good time, I think its how they're raised. If you think about it I get my mom @PERCENT1 of the time and my dad @PERCENT1 of the time. Whenever I'm with my dad I'm always in a worse mood, I never want to do what he's asking. I basically want to rebel. When I'm with my mom I literally do the opposite I'm always happier and will do what she wants, and we always laugh and have a way better relationship then me and my dad do. I think laughing and being happier has a lot to do with who you look up to and how they act, and what they do. I can definitely tell my mood change from parent to parent. It has a lot to do with how the parents are raising their kids. I think as a adult you need to be a positive influence on your kid/teenager. I think its good to have a healthy laughing relationship with your kid. Life is to short to spend it hating someone, I believe you should spend your life having a good time and fulfilling your dreams, and mostly laughing.

I wish they would not ,but they feel the need to take things off the shelves if so. They feel that if someone can find some kind of offensive thing then they will feel it is okay to say or do thoughs things that they read or hear. It also commine sence to not do thoughs things that people wrote about. The auther's wright things to intertane and to egicate us about things that where okay in the time peroid that the story in this case was okay back then.     Most people these day take things way to serous now mostly because we have things like lawsuits and dercrimation. If someone can find something to complane about they will do so. if there is a book out there that is about back in the day when @CAPS1's had slave's and if there calling them a name that is not very nice. Then someone and complain and say that it is rashal and there will be a disbute about it and the auther will most likely loose and have to change that word into something els. People do not relise how much this happens it happens a lot expeshally with books.      Movies are a whole different thing now the things that happen on the movies get away with it mostly because they have money to get away with. There is a reason why things are @CAPS9 @CAPS2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, and @CAPS4. @CAPS2 is for children under the age @NUM1. There are serten things that can be in though's movies. @CAPS2 @NUM1 there can be a lot more things it can be scarry to an extent and there also sometimes sexual things ,but they do not show the whole thing. There also can be villons and some swaring not a lot though. @CAPS9 @CAPS4 that's a whole new level they can have anything they really want and its a little more than @CAPS2 @NUM1 they kind of have a little more graphic than @CAPS2 @NUM1. Sometimes they have to choose between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @CAPS9 @CAPS4 it depends on how graphic things are.     Music is a whole other thing depending on what kind of music you are lissening to like theres @CAPS11, @CAPS4 & @CAPS13, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS17, and exedra. with all thoughs they talk about sex and volints. Now all of them excepent contry talk about drugs and @ORGANIZATION1 talks about @ORGANIZATION1. There are some that talks about more things, but most of them thats what they talk about. If perents do not want there childeren lissening to it then they do not lissen. there are ways of still lissening to it. most radio stations they can not swre on the radio, but they just cut it out. there are ways to have the uncut version, but thats on a @CAPS18, @CAPS19, or @CAPS20 @NUM7 player. There are ways to get around it.     See i think that it is dumb to take things like that away mostly, because they are going to see or hear about it someday anyways expeshally when they are in high school. Most teens do things with out there parents knowing and when they start driving they can lissen to whatever they want. Also they can read anything they want too, because they can buy the book and read it and hid it. Face it kids even younger find ways to do things that their parents do not want them to do. Matter what age they are they find ways to do what they want if they want it bad enoff. I think if a school wants to read something than they should have to have parents exent about it and if the kids can not read it than they can do something els insted or read something els. Do not take thing off the shelve just, because a couple of students can read or watch it. Your spoilling it for the kids that want to and can it is really unfair to the rest of the students they can not hepl it that there parents wont let them.

3490,2,"The material that someone people believe shouln't be viewed by childern, I don't believe should be removed from the library shelves just for that reason.     The library is not just for the children but also for the adults. Children are exposed to many things everyday that are not suited for them, whether it be in their home, at school, or even while their out in public. So why alter the library just for the children, when we don't even alter the public for them? I think if having certain material that isn't suitable for certain ages, then the children should be monitored closely on what they are pulling from shelves. By pulling something from a shelf just because a parent doesn't want their child to see, hear, or watch it, isn't right to the older people that come to the library.     Another reason i don't agree with removing things is because, by removing items that are not suited for a child is like saying we should move the childrens things off of shelves, because the adults have no use for them. Their are always many ways to suit both the needs of a child and the needs of an adult in a library, and still keep the children from what they shouldn't read. Most children are so amused by their own materials in the library they are not worried about the adult things. If everything a parent didn't want their child to see ws pulled from the selves, then there would be no use for the older people to come to the library. Their only custmors left would be the children, and that wouldn't be much business, because the parent's wouldn't want to stay because they wouldn't have anything to entertain them for the toe being.

1175,1,"Dear people, Computers have been here for not a very long time and everyday more people buy computers and everyday people use them. As they are used for entertainment, education, and talking with people faraway, they have had a negative effect on people. Let me explain. First of all, as people use computers in the beginning they enjoy it. They go on the @CAPS1, play games, and use it for work. But as they keep using it, they start to get addicted. People are addicted to computers because of the games and being able to go on the @CAPS1. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all the people in this @CAPS3 who owns a @CAPS8, is addicted to computers. That percentage is expected to grow to @PERCENT2 in the next @NUM1 years. Addiction to computers lead to serious issues. People have died because they spent too much time on the @CAPS8 without eating and sleeping. In another newspaper not long ago, it stated that a student attending @ORGANIZATION1, was dropped out for doing so poorly during school. His parent found out that he was addicted to this game ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4."" This game is right now the most played game on the @CAPS8 in this @CAPS3. Studies state that @CAPS8 addiction is almost as bad as smoking addiction. My second reason why @CAPS8 has a negative effect on people is because of online bullying. People chat on @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and email and people are bullied. A friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling. Online bullying is worse that inteacting bullying. That's because @CAPS9 you say something on the @CAPS8, people don't know who you are. @PERSON1, a proffesor who recently did studies of online bullying says, ""Online bullying has become more severe than contact to contact bullying. People are threatened more and hear more bad words than interacting."" The online bullying and harassment is going to get worse @CAPS9 people don't stop. Also people can get arrested for what they write online. My final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise @CAPS8 contribute about @PERCENT3 to overweight people. On the @CAPS8, everything is much easier. Instead of mailing, you could e-mail. You can listen to music instead of walking up to the radio and turning it on. You could buy tickets, shop, talk with friends, and have fun just by sitting on a @CAPS8. But this is why people become overweight and obese. @PERCENT4 of the people who use computers are obese or overweight. Peole spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people and parents should control their child's time on the computers. Just because of a @CAPS8, many issues rise. So @CAPS9 you think you are addicted, try to make a time schedule for your whole day. Use the @CAPS8 for an hour a time and take rests before using it again.

20846,8," Laughter is a symbol of joy and happiness. It is to become amused or derisive. Many people today make jokes or funny remarks just to hear somebody laugh. It is never something we should take for granted. Through many relationships no matter what kind, I believe laughter takes up at least @PERCENT1 of your relationship. It's to show the best out of someone and to let them know you are listening. There are plenty of other reasons in this world needed for laughter. ""I'm sure you can even think of one"".  In my views of this world and our society today, I believe laughter is what makes up our ""human"" spirit. It's to show ourselves and other people the spark we have inside us. Have you ever sat and pondered why we make each other laugh? I have asked myself this same question over and over. For me making people laugh is letting them know I care and to also think I'm funny as well. We even do it just the fact of wanting people to like us better and to be known as funny, hilarious, or just a good person to talk to. Sometimes we can go to the extremes of being to funny, and feeling guilty for picking on someone in a laughable way.  I remember in the eighth grade, I was thirteen years old. I was really shy and didn't have much friends. One day in class some of the popular kids actually came over and started talking to me. I was @CAPS1 excited and nervous that other kids wanted to talk to me. Of course they were laughing and making jokes, not caring what anyone else was saying. Then this one girl started talking about other people like she knew everything. When she started talking about my best friend it made me angry but happy at the same time, because some of the things she was saying were true. That's were I messed up, I started talking about all the other dumb things she did, just to make everybody else laugh. As I was sitting there all I felt was guilt and disappointment in myself. I couldn't believe I was sitting there talking about my best friend, just to try and make myself popular. Later that day she came up to me really upset and couldn't understand why I would do that to her. I told her I was sorry and that I only did it to make myself popular and seem funny to other kids. We didn't talk for almost two weeks. @CAPS1 I tried to do everything in my own possible way to get my best friend back. It did take me awhile, but she finally came around and forgave me. It was a good life lesson for me, knowing laughter @MONTH1 not always be a good thing. Now me and my friend are juniors in high school and when we think back on that day. We both together can share a laugh. In conclusion, you can see how laughter can bring somebody up and tear them down. I have experienced these things as well in my life time.

Does it try to mask @CAPS7 really might be happening in this world or does it try to make you feel all happy about this horrendous place that you live in? To one person a book could be very offensive and to their neighbor it could have a whole new, opposite meaning. Its all in perspective.     Personally, i think that taking out some of the 'offensive' book in libraries could be a diaster. In one book that we read this year in my @CAPS1 class was '@CAPS2 @NUM1'. This book was all about a distopia where people burnt books who didn't send the right message to society. People were numb to feelings and that could be the outcome of censorship in the libraries around the @LOCATION1. Libraries are a place that sparks imangination for all ages and if you censor things out then how is that suppose to happen?     Looking at books in the past that were defied as 'offensive' and taken off of the shelves at libraries and banned to read in @CAPS1 class at school, were mostly about womens rights and @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Some of then just had bad words in them and others about dystopias. If you took out all af those books that pertained to these topics how many books would you ave left? And for that matter, my best friend is an @CAPS3 @CAPS6 girl and we both have equal rights now and we both have jobs so @CAPS7 is the big deal with living in the past? Theres is also the fact that it is innevitable to get away from cursing everywhere you go. All along the streets, in schools and sometimes even in church. So if you are around it in real life then why can't you read about it?     Now when people who are all for the cenorship in libraries say something to the affect of ' @CAPS7 about the children, i dont want them reading a book that i think is offensive,' i say then cenor them. Its your own choice on how you raise your kids but other parents think that you should have an imagination instead of the same old, same old. Its good to have a varity of things to read that doesn't limit the brain.      All in all, i think people who would want to censor books are crazy and it could potentually be taken way out of hand and then a distpoia society would form. Children should not be dissillusioned on @CAPS7 the world is and could be.

4422,2,"Books, music, movies, and magazines are all a form of expression. We have the freedom to @ORGANIZATION1 the way we feel or think, but can it be to graphic for some to read? I believe censorship in libraries are needed to protect the minds of children and people who are easily influenced by the thoughts of others.     Books are a major factor in expressing the way one feels about a topic from romance to horror. Many children like to read books or comic books that invovle a great deal of violence. Childrens mind's are like sponges, which means they soke up anything they read about and it has a great chance at influencing their functioning to everyday activities.      If you go into a music store you will find many different types of music from rap to blue grass. I've noticed in my school that a particular type of music that stands out is rap and the favorite artist is @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 has been known for rapping about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many teens think that if their favorite artist can do all this why can't they? I've only listened to a few songs by @ORGANIZATION2 and in every song one of those four key topics comes up.      Like @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 the movie industry is starting to come out with more and more movies about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many students in my school talk about the latest comedy movies like '@ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS1', '@CAPS2' ect. and how they turned their life into something like those movies when they go on @DATE1 or @DATE2 break. Movies like those are funny to watch but for someone who is easily influenced shouldn't be watching them.     Books, music, movies, and magazines, they surround us with their stories and thoughts of another human being. We do have the freedom and the right to @ORGANIZATION1 ourselves but we also have the right to take it away if we feel it is endangering the minds of others.

1602,1,"Dear editor, Computers have a good effect on humans. The reason is because you can interact with friends and family that they know, the computer @MONTH1 be portable so you can still get outside, and lastely people can research places where they want to go on vacation. These reasons are how computers have a good effect on humans. To begin with, seeing people in person is not the only way to communicate, on the computer there is many ways. There are chat rooms, that have typing to eachother. Take my friend @PERSON5 for example, he used to live in @LOCATION2 with all his friends and family until buisiness came along. His buisiness transfered @PERSON5 all the way to @LOCATION1. Thank god he had a computer, because other wise he would not have able to communicate with his friends. @PERSON5 is not the only person in which he is transfered far away from home. In fact, @PERSON4 showed @PERCENT1 of people with a computer tend to talk to friends and family more often because they can do it whenever they need. Gene a phsychyatrist states that when someone in a family has to leave to go on buisiness, then that family will start relying on a computer to communicate. Do you want to lose a friend or family member? Moreover, computers @MONTH1 be portable. If a computer is portable then you can see nature and still use the computer to get the job done. Take my cousin @PERSON2 is a teacher and always has to do his students grades during the weekend. He was bummed out because he could never get outside. So for his birthday, he got a portable computer, this allowed him to go outside and do his job while getting fresh air and seeing nature. @PERSON2 is one of many lucky people that has had this happen to them. @PERSON6 has shown that @PERCENT2 of teachers buy portable computers so they can see nature and get fresh-air while doing their job. @PERSON1, proved that if a teacher doesn't get any fresh air while doing their job then they can make a valuable mistake or even get sick. Would you, a teacher, want to get sick with no fresh air or be healthy working out doors? Lastly, there is more to do on computers than doing work and communicating with friends and family. You can research places for vaction. My aunt @PERSON3 had always dreamed of going on vacation but couldn't find any information on fun, outdoor places. Until, she got her hands on a computer. This way she found a fun place and left the country for week. @PERSON3 is not the only person this has happened to. In fact, @ORGANIZATION1 shows that @PERCENT3 of people hesitate to go on vaction because they don't know about the country or place.",5,5,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1050,1,"Dear @PERSON2 ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1"" I'm sure you all have heard the sound of a mouse or people typing if you have walk into an office, our local library, a doctor's office, or even our districts schools. The reality is that computers and the world-wide-web is seem and used everywhere. Without a computer, how would @CAPS3 be able to access our emails, interact with family memmber across the ocean and finish that research paper out teacher has assigned us? In my opinion, computers hace a phenomenal affect on people and their lives. The computer helps develope hand-eye coordination, learn about specifil subjects and interact with people on the computer. Therefore, with such positive affects, @CAPS3 should keep using this wonderful technology and get our jobs done. Have you ever walked into your schools lab or walked into a office building and all you could hear was the clicking of mouses or the buttons being pressed down on the keyboard? Well, not only is a job being completed, but you are also exercising I remember last month when my class was assigned a five page essay. After the second page, my hands hurt very badly, @CAPS4, not only was i completing my essay, I was also exercising my hands. Not only does computers allow you to exercise, it also helps develops hand-eye coordination. Have you ever played a game where you had to cath fist, or playes a fast-pasle game of pinball? Well, those games require one key thing i hand-eye coordination. Computers are very helpful in todays world. The computer and the world-wide-web is useful in several other ways too. The internet also allows you to learn about certain subject or events you might not have a book for. My bestfriend, @PERSON1, called me one day from the train. On the phone, she was frantic because she was giving a speech and she did not know what the statistic was for type @CAPS5 diabetes. What do you do when you have no book for a specific subject? @PERSON3 went on her laptop and found all the information she she dit not know. this is just another way the quick acces to a computer benefits people. ""You've got mail"" I'm sure you have all heard this before. Besides communicating through letters or on the telephone, the internet has also given us more ways for fast communication. when you need to confirm a meeting place or ask your classmate what problems were assigned homework, what could be a fast mean of communication? Sending a instant message, or e-mail are two ways of course. Not only does computers allow you to communicate quickly but also privately. Both your e-mail account and you instant message account have passwords so that only you can access them. Every four out of five households have a computer avalable for completing assignments, checking, e-mails and learning about the, that happend in @LOCATION1 last week. The computer has put a positive affect on numerous people and their everyday need. In my opinion, the computer has been one of the best technologies in history. This amazing technology has helped students, teachers, doctors, police officers and even you bank aggents serve our community and make it a better one. Thank-you.",6,5,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3209,2,Hi my name is @PERSON1 I have a couple topics that I would       like to talk to you about. I have been hearing alot of people          talking about libraries taking alot of there stuff off the shelves      well I think that that the libraries around the world have alot        of information inside of them and if we started taking                  information out of them then what would be the point in              having them. I think that everything in libraries are very               important and who is to know that everybody wants this to          happen. The one thing that I dont really think that libraries           need in them is movies because like pretty much every movie      has a book that goes with it or is the same thing pretty much.       And lets get on with the whole offensive thing I think everone      should be mature about all the negative stuff people can say         even if it is hurtfull. Though I think that the more people read      about what people are saying about them is the less that              they are goin to care because they are goin to just be so used       to it that they are not even goin to know what they are                talking about.

The affects on them are that people get learn things easier. There are millions of a job sites that would have to do with something of learning. About @NUM1 of collage students go online and do challenge. If you were a collage student and did collage online you would: see your family more won't be a hassle to get to collage and would be easier to concentrate being by your self and learning. Also they even make stone which is very popular learning a different language and where you learn this from is on a computer. My second reason is to talk on the . About @NUM2 of our daily! Online phone you and you can also the cool them even more that have you talk to give . I know have a facebook give don't get think it would be a good chore. up free.

But this caused problems too. They couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building or it would be unstable. But most importantly since the winds kept changing it would never stay still. The problem of foreign blimps using hydrogen rather than helium made it to dangerouse to the public. In conclusion The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in trying to let blimps dock.",3,3,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9505,4,The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saeng’s  determination .  I  say this hibiscus in  the  story the sees  the  plant and it joyed to see it and is so happy but the reminders doing her grandmother ‘s  hair she  tries.  She snow this as a test for herself . She  want to see if she could be on and try not will on the past . When she  isn’t  home she said “ I failed the test .” This snows melt she want is to move on but it hasn’t  as  easy as she hope it to be. So when the as this hibiscus the shows life this paragraph it shows that Saeng is trying  to move on and she is different  to  a English her seal.,1,2,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4758,2,"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I don't think so, these items should stay on the shelves for the appropriate ages. If you are over the age of eighteen you should be able to pick and chose to what ever topic they want. If you are under the age of eighteen there should be an age requirement and also require parent consent.      For those under eighteen when they get a library membership they should have to verify thier date of birth, and what thier parent srequest their child to be able to read, play, or watch. Librarys and book stores should put a rating on the magazines or books, just like movies. This will promote less parents of anger for thier children listening to music or reading inappropriate books, magazines, or video games. Now if books stores sell these books to underage children without parent consent, there can be charges pressed. It would be pretty much the same thing as selling liquor, or cigarettes to a minor.     From my observations with my little brother, my mother chose to let him play inappropriate video games. For instance these games consisted of violence, sex, drugs, and foul language. In result of this I notice that my brother does not obey, or treat my mother with the respect as he should. He also misbehaves in school constantly. That is just one example of the many I know of.     Even if the parent gives permission for thier child to watch offensive movies, play inappropriate video games, or read certain books that are not suitable for his/her age, they should still have to be a certain age. Some parents make poor decisions on thier parenting, and it will reflect them later in life.     So my overall opinion would be no. Keep the books on the shelf for the people that are mature enough to watch, read, or play. If they limit the selling of these items to minors, these children @DATE1 will not have as many crimes all together. There would be less violence, and drug offenses or abuse. Keep this all in mind.                                                                 @ORGANIZATION1",4,4,,4,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3126,2,"Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? If a library feels that if a book is too graphic, a movie too violent or that music to agressive then its their own choice to remove it or not. It is true that that it's pointless to try and censor the lives of kids and teenagers.Explicit content is all around not only in the media and literature. The never ending game of shielding this generations teenagers and children is already finished.     In this point in time, the main focus of alot of movies and music and books is something violent, agressive, inapproiate, or explicit. The idea of removing these things from library shelves is pointless. The will always be violence and crime in todays world along with excessive swares and cuss words all around. It's exceptable that some parents don't want their children reading,watching or listening to something they don't or wouldn't approve of but even if the kids are protected and home out in the world sometimes the parents wont be there.     Libraries are public places, and a percent of the audience would be upset, frusterated or angr if the books, music or movies they liked were no longer avalable due to the cencorship. It @MONTH1 seem as if viewing, reading or listening to something violent or explicit, would have an effect on the listener. On the streets, at school, at the park and more places children and teens will be exposed to this type or explicit language so attempting to cencor it in their reading and viewing matterial is just pointless.        In my experence I have grown up and been around people who have grown up listening to violent music, watching graphic movies and more explicit material and not been effected. I saw my first rated @CAPS1 movie when i was nine, so parents can give thier kids somewhat of an age but at one point trying to cencor anything is a waste of time. With schools now teaching their students the positives of being abstinent and the sexual deseases, students are more likely to refrain despite what they see in movies, read about, or listen to. Any child exposed to the internet could be subject to all kinds of inapproite material, explicit canotent, bad language, cuss words, and disturbing images.     Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? Trying to block the explicity and violence in the world is an endless battle. Certain things @MONTH1 go over the line, but others are just renactments and previews of whats really going on in this world.Why would you hinder the real world away from children and teenagers? Movies have a rating and music @CAPS4 have an explicit content label so people should know whats approiate for themselves. The first sware word a child hears probably wasnt in a song or movie and was probably somewhere in the real world.",4,4,,4,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3283,2,"i think that the libraries in generally shouldn't take themusic,movies, or the magazines away. Because you never know what goes on at there home and they just want to get   away and relax the self at the library to read. I think that they shouldn't take the books off the the shelves just for a reason because people love going to the library.And if they don't have those things then what the point of going there.my other thing that they shouldn't take those things away is thatthey will not make a profit. when the people go to the libraryand they dont see those things they are going to wonder want happen.i think that it shouldn't be the children fault that all of the books are gone. It should be the owners and the people that work at the library fault that they made them take the booksoff the shelves.I also think that when the children goes to the library they are going to ask there parent or someone.Where are the book because they want to read and also where are the book so they can check them out.But the people would want to keep getting the books from the library to check them out.I think that the people should not take the books off the shelves for a specific reason and that reason is that people and children would go like on a weekend to read if they dont have any of those things at home.My thing is that they shouldn't just remove anything at all because it going to be a big commotion. So  by removing all of  that would be sad because what if no one has no place to go and they are feeling loney and they want to go the library and read. but my whole point agbout it is that who came up with no books,music or magzines on the shelves.But i also think that if they did that in the real world. Then it would be terrible and a crisis to the people.I think that they should not do that because the people love to read listen to music and etc. I also think that they should not do that because people love going to to releave some stress that they might have and they jus want to go there.I also think that they might not do it anyways because they know the people love there jobs to not to.One of the things that i like is that when i go to the library it is nice and quiet and we can listen to our ipod or our @NUM1 player something like that.Some people just love to go so that they can see there friends and communicate with them to get on the computer.

3200,2,"I believe that censorship should be allowed when it comes to certain things but I don't believe censorship belongs in public libraries.  Books are wrote to stimulate the imagination of a persons mind and if they cannot read books that are the slightest offensive, then they will never know what it is like to open some of the greatest books ever wrote until that person has grown up.  And there are several studies that show that books stimulate the human mind and taking away these books would be a crushing blow to those statistics.     For example, a student has been assigned a report on a piece of classical literature.  So he/she goes to the public library to find a good book, but when that student gets the he/she finds out that all pieces of classical literature have been removed from the library due to being overly offensive.  What would that person do?  Should he/she just give up because every single piece of classical literature has been taken out of every library in the country, I say no!       This is a problem because almost every great book ever wrote has at least a few parts where it is slightly offensive to that certain reader.  From personal experience I can back this statement up with books I have read going through my school career.  For example, when I was in the @NUM1 grade  was assigned a book report over @PERSON1, so I went to our library in the school to look for this book and it was nowhere to be found.  I asked the librarian where this book was and she said that it had been removed due to being offensive to the black population for having the word negro inprinted on its pages.  So I asked her if I could go tot the public library to get the book and she said that it had been removed from its shelves as well.  I did not know what to do, I was completely clueless and I had no book to write my report over.  So eventually the teacher had to change the report topic because not on student was able to find @PERSON1.  But if the state had not allowed these books to be taken off of the shelves then we would not have had this problem.     Another example was when my friend @PERSON2 wanted to learn about his culture and where his ancestors came from.  But when he got to the library he could not find any books over the arabic world.  So he asked the librarian 'where are all the books covering @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION1?'  And the librarian said that they were all removed because after @NUM2 @CAPS1 saw arabs as very offensive people and that no books were left unchecked.  I'm sure that he found this comment to be very offensive but there was nothing that he could do about it because the white people found arabs to be offensive and unequal to the white race.     These are only a few things that have already happened becaue of people finding certain books to be offensive, which is why I believe that the government should leave all the books on the shelves and let the people decide to pick up that book or pass it by.  Sure people have a freedom of speech but it should not effect what books belong on the shelf.  Which is why I believe that censorship should not be allowed to effect libraries of the public.",4,4,,4,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4667,2,"Censorship in librarys can be a positive and negative thing. I think this because there can be somethings that you @MONTH1 not want your children to read. But there also can be things that you do want them to read. Age groups can play a big role in censorship because there are things that you dont want to see a kid reading when he or she is young. But if it is censored then they will not even be able to read it when they get older. It all depends on what kind of things are in the books, music, movies, and magazines.     If you find something offensive that you read in a book or saw in a magazine to some people that @MONTH1 not be offensive at all. This is why I think that the censorship can be good and bad. I am sure that there @MONTH1 be somethings that you have read that wasn't offensive to you but it @MONTH1 still be offensive to others. Censorship in my opinion can be a good thing when the things that are in the book, movie, magazine, and music are not true and that @MONTH1 be offensive to more than a small group. Lets say that there are two books written about the same true topic. The first books material is very well written and @MONTH1 have offensive material in it here and there. The second book is also well written but @MONTH1 not all be there the whole story @MONTH1 not be the same as what happened because they censored it because it can't be in the library. Which would you rather read? Personally I would rather read the book that @MONTH1 have some offensive material but has the complete story of what happend.     Say you were the writer of a book and it took you a long time of hard work and dedication to finish the book and get it published. Would you want your book to be on the shelf at the library? I know I would but if your writing about something that happend in your life that could have been offensive to others they @MONTH1 not allow that book on the shelf of a library. If the things that are in the book are true or are in real life. Than why show your children a book that isn't true? Im not saying go get your child a war book and have them read it when they are very young. When reading a book that someone spent a long time and lots of hard work on you are looking into their perspective. Maybe there perspective of what happend is alot different than yours, but that can be a good thing. Even with the offensive material books, movies, magazines, and music can still be good to some people and bad to others.     I have went to librarys and found books that I was interested in and I think that some of them could be found offensive to others. If the contents of the book, movie, magazine, and the music are not true and can be found offensive then sure that should be censored. But if it is censored it should only be for a certain age group. I have also went and got books at the library that have true stories that can be found offensive by some people, but that doesn't mean it should be censored. A book that @MONTH1 have material in them that could be 'bad' for some people. That does not mean that after they read it they are going to go start using the same offensive language that could be in the book. It all depends on the persons perspective if they find a book offensive or that has some 'bad' material in it then don't read it, and find something that you wouldnt find offensive.     Overall the things that we read, watch, and listen to @MONTH1 not all be bad even if it has some offensive material in it. To some it can be bad to others it can be part of their life. If I had a story to tell and I spent a long time working on it. I would want it to be read, seen, and heard. Censorship @MONTH1 be good for some and bad for others. If you are a person that allways likes a happy ending then maybe censorship is good.

The author states, ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This would have been a major problem. Another obstacle was the violent air currents that made it hard to land. In this essay it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This quote shows why landing would be dangerous. Finally, it was illegal to fly airships too low over urban areas. The text explains, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area."" this shows how even if everything worked, they wouldn't be able to do it These are just three of the obstacles that prevented the builders of the Empire State Building from docking dirigibles.",4,3,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3559,2,"Well today i am going to talk to you about censorship in books, Music, Movies, an Magazines  in your libraries, because some of them can be pretty grafic on some of the things they talk about or do in a story. But yes some of them can be more grafic than others, but that doesnt mean you have to take them off the self. Ya not everyone is into a sexual book but there are some people out there that like to read about that stuff. But some people like to read about murders an gangs selling drugs and thats fine. Its like this everyone has their own taste on what they like. it can be a novel, @ORGANIZATION1. Sports, @CAPS1,  just a true story that has happen to someone, an etc. thats just the part of the world. how would it be if everyone liked the same things. pretty boring right yeah deffentally.  So therefore i dont think books should be takin off the shelfs. it could be the next best story for somebody. you never know.     Now with music yes your so called rap today is music that your kids should not listen to. All they talks about is sex, drugs, achole, an etc. But that desnt give you the right to take them off the shelf thats what some people like to listen too. but there is some music out there that dont just talk about that. there is the oldies, country, jazz, hip hop, an etc. but for the most part all music is good its just some of them are better than others, lets take country for instents ya it talks about some sex, an some achole but thats not the whole song they manly talk about country boys an the things they do or have happened to them over time, an they are pretty much right. So all music is good, but without music i dont think the world would be a very nice place. people listen to music all the time. when working out, at work, driving, or just siting at home. So there are some good music an bad muic you make the call.     But with movies there are some movies made just for that reason its all call intertainment for adults. which yes is kinda pointless, but its there an prolly wont ever leave. there are movies made for sex, drugs, an achole. thats just the part of life, everything is not perfect. So in that matter you gota tell your children about this stuff in stop them from watching it at a younge age. because i think it is taking a big role in teen pregnecy, beacuse it they see it an hey it looks fun we shoud try it, and sexual content is so easy to get. its all over the web an etc. its like drugs they are so easy to get. there are meth labs all over for meth. an there is weed all arund. you just gota tell your kids what they can watch an cant. Disney, @ORGANIZATION2, an @CAPS2. are all great shows for kids. so parents be the boss about that stuff.     Now we get to Magazines. there are millions of magazines all aound the world, they are one thing that will never leave this world. they carry news, intertainment, comics, or tips on how to do somethng. thats what is going to be in this world till the world ends. But yes take with caution there are some magazines out there that your children should never look at till adults. but that doesent make them bad people injoy looking at them kinda magazines thats just what people like. its not like your going to stop your son from looking at a @CAPS3. or your daughter from looking at porn. its all apart of life. but you can stop it from happening at a younge age. you just gota get it clear to your child to not look at this stuff till your older. but you cant stop everything.

He said ok and we went. when we  got there, there were no other stores that were open. When we went inside there were like a billion people in there. I was so hungry I could eat a pig. Metarorickly speaking. We went to the chicken area and we asked how long we would have to wait. And the guy at the counter said about two hours. After about @NUM1. I started to read a magazine and some people left but the people in front of us went in those seats. We were next to go sit down but it took about an hour. Before some people left. I didn't complain at all and I didn't ever talk at all, and I talk a lot. And that was the time I was very patient.",8,9,,17,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,,,,,,

21155,8,"                                              The @CAPS1 Of @DATE2 The warm @DATE2 sun, pools to cool down children, parents joining with friends and family to have picnics and potlucks, and late night slumber parties. Then there's my @DATE2 @CAPS1.The sunshine came in bright throughout the window illuminating the whole room, I awoke to see the bright light of the sun. I ran into my brother @PERSON2's room, to make sure he was up and ready to start the day with me. He clearly was; the early riser himself. We left his room and started to smell the sweet aroma of chocolate chip cookies, we booked it down the hall into the kitchen to talk to mom about what we were going to do that day. When we got there mom turned around to show us her gigantic belly, which was holding my soon to be baby brother, we asked her what we were doing that day. Disappointed at her answer she had nothing planned. My brother and I were bummed but we quickly got dressed and went to the backyard where we were pitching together, the ball hit softly on my nice leather glove while on my brothers it made a slap. My mom came outside and yelled to @PERSON2 to go over to the sliding glass door, for a second I thought I was in trouble for pitching too hard to @PERSON2 but luckily that wasn't the case. My mom then called me over as well to let me know my cousin was coming over. My first thought was great @ORGANIZATION2's coming over! Then I started to think, my cousin @ORGANIZATION2 is weird... she is always making up lies, telling non funny jokes, playing with @PERSON1 @CAPS2 cards, and playing weird stupid video games. I quickly ask my mom when she is coming so I can ready myself, for whatever I am going to have to put up with my mom tells me fifteen minutes. I quickly run past her into my room where my phone is, and call my neighbors @DATE1 and @ORGANIZATION1 to see if I could hang out. Their mom answers and says I can come over there as soon as the girls chores are done, excited I tell my mom I will be at the neighbors house for a little while and @PERSON2 would have to hang with @ORGANIZATION2 while I'm gone. Shes tells me that its alright as long as I leave before @ORGANIZATION2 gets here. I await the phone call telling me that I can go over to their house. Noon is rolling around and they still haven't called, @ORGANIZATION2 will be here soon and I am tired of waiting. I decide to go out front where I can roller-blade around the block, I tell @PERSON2 that I am going outside and he tags alone with me. @PERSON2 and I put on our roller blades and head out of the garage, my mom comes out right as we are about to leave and tells us @ORGANIZATION1 called and we can go over there now, we rush in and quickly try to step up the stairs in the garage to the house. Slipping as we try to shove each other out of the way with the roller blades on, I finally get inside and start unhooking the latches. Get them off and head for the door when all of the sudden I hear a knock just as I reach for the door, it's @ORGANIZATION2. I hurry out the the door saying hello to my cousin as I quickly escape to the neighbors house. I get to @ORGANIZATION1's house and we decide to go outside to play, and run with her new puppy. We play for a little while then decide we should go inside and get a snack we do, then the doorbell rings. @ORGANIZATION1 runs to the door with the puppy at her heels and lets the people in, I turn around from the table to see who it is and see @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON2 standing inside the door. They came over to play too, I let @DATE1 know we should watch a movie. She went over to the movie cabinet and pulled out the brand new @CAPS3 movie!  We all sit down and start to watch the movie each with a bowl of popcorn. We watched almost all of it when the doorbell rang, the puppy bolted to the door and @DATE1 got up to answer it this time my mom stepped inside and told @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON2 and I that it was time to leave. The puppy was ecstatic to see my mother so she peed all over the linoleum floor. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't notice the dog pee on the floor, so she ran for the door to get her shoes on and she went flying backwards into the dog pee everyone was laughing even @ORGANIZATION2. We said our thank you's and headed back to my house to eat dinner and get @ORGANIZATION2 ready to leave. The most enjoyable moments are with the people you love, they can make you laugh and cry. : @CAPS4.",16,20,,36,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,
