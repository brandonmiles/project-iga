280,1,"Dear @LOCATION1, I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. They even allow people to talk online. Computers are a very usefull piece of machinery. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. When your in school, you need to type lots of @CAPS1 prompts, @CAPS2 labs, and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 vocab. Computers help us do that. Typing fast and correctly takes practice. Typing without looking at the keyboard is hand-eye coordination. This will help us later on in life also. Whether it's typing term papers in high school or your application essay for college, you will need the help of computers. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places. @NUM1 years ago I look a trip to @LOCATION3 for the first time. I didn't know a lot about the history of @LOCATION3 so I sat down at my desk and turned on my computer. Suddenly, it was like I was in @LOCATION3! I read about the delicious food and rich culture. I took a virtual tour of the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and the great @CAPS7. I heard @CAPS8 music and learned some @CAPS8. In just @NUM2 hour I visited @LOCATION3 right from my very own house! Computers can take you on a magical journey to a far away country. Computers allow people to talk to online with other people. This is a very good thing. I have cousins who live in @LOCATION2 and because of the @NUM3 hour time difference, its not always easy to talk on the phone so we use the computer. My family will send e-mails back and forth with them. Sometimes we will even video chat! @CAPS3 networking sights accesible by computer such as @CAPS10 or @CAPS11 allow us to talk to people who we don't regularly see. On @CAPS11 you can even talk to your favorite stars or musicians. Computers let us keep in touch with others. Computers have a positive effect on people. Some experts @MONTH1 say that people spend too much time on the computer and while that @MONTH1 be true to some people, its not true to everyone. We still exersise, and spend time outside. We still interact with family and friends but know we are also able to do so on the computer. More and more people using computer is a good thing.",5,5,10,"ID1,ORG2,STY2"
12753,5,"By writing the story, the author created a mood full of warmth and comfort. The mood created in this story shows how family should be. When @PERSON1 says that ""they take anyone in until they are back on their feet"", this shows that they appreciate their family and they are all close. This shows that they care for one another contributes to the mood by showing love and warmth towards another person. A second way about the mood is when he talks about his kitchen and how much it means to him. When he talks about the love of culinary skills and cooking which is still with him today it creates a solemn mood that sets the tone of the story. Third, where he talks about his neighborhood. @PERSON1 talks about the immigrants in the area and how they come together with their different backgrounds. This shows that they show affection for one another and that everyone is the same. This sets the mood too by showing everybody needs to be nice to everyone. These three parts set the ""mood of the story.",3,3,3,"ID2,ORG2,STY3"
16086,6,"Base on the excerpt, the obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. My prodiction is he doesn't want it around because the Empire State Building is way to high and the blimps is like floating Right above it. Something may have, thats what I think Al Smith is worried about. My backup answer is the statement he said ""it's on the level, all right. ""No kidding"". We're on the thing now. One set of engineer here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast"" it seems like hes confused about the whole situation.",0,0,0,"ID3,ORG3,STY3"

12060,5,"The mood created by the author in the memoir is many things. But, I think the main moods in the memoir are happy and greatful. I think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times @PERSON1 had in his house. For example, @PERSON1 says ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" And, I think the mood of the story is also thankful because a lot of the story has to do with @PERSON1 thanking his parents for all they have done and sacrificed for him. For example, in the end of the memoir @PERSON1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" and in a way thanks his parents for everything. So, as you can see those are the moods I think the author created in the memoir.",2,3,3,"ID2,ORG2,STY3"

13151,5,The mood created by the author in this memoir is greatfulness. The memoir showed how greatful Narciso's was to his parents. Their bravery and selflessness must have truley impacted his life then and probaly how he lives today. It also give the feeling of respect. In this memoir it shows how much he truley respected his parents and community. And last I think it gives the mood of admiration. The memoir really expressed how much he admired his parents and community. It showed how much he admired his parents bravery and he admired his overcoming of odds. He also admired how a community of different races could get over that and pull toghether to really make a community.Those are some of the moods that ar expressed in this memoir.,2,2,2,"ID2,ORG2,STY3"
20827,8," I didn't believe my grandfather when @CAPS2 told me laughing could cure anything. I was nine years old, the days were dark @CAPS3 cold @CAPS3 I felt like my life was a shattered piece of a stain glass window. Not only had @PERSON2, my ageless pit bull, just died @CAPS6 also my little sister would tease me if I dared to shed a tear for the lost of my best pet. I sat on the coach, staring at the fire as it crackled @CAPS3 popped, when my grandfather sat down beside me @CAPS3 told me a story. It was about him, when @CAPS2 was young @CAPS3 how lost @CAPS1 best friend too, only @CAPS1 friend wasn't a pet. ""@CAPS1 name was @PERSON3,"" @CAPS2 began, ""@CAPS3 we were eleven years old. Oh, how we had so much fun. All we did was @CAPS7! We thought we were gonna grow old together @CAPS3 be each others best men @CAPS3 cause trouble tell the end. @CAPS2 was my best friend until the end. I loved him, very much like how you love @PERSON2. I never thought anything would happen to him. I thought that we'd both live forever. @CAPS6 then something did happened. @PERSON3, @CAPS2 had gone fishing alone because I was at church @CAPS3 @CAPS1 @CAPS4 had to work, @CAPS3 it was such a wonderful day to @CAPS11 down to the river @CAPS6 then @CAPS2 never came back from the river..."" @CAPS5 sniffled at the old story, "" @CAPS6 you see, @PERSON1, there's a cure for sadness. Do you want to know @CAPS9 it is?"" I nodded half thinking there was a magical medication or spell. ""@CAPS7."" @CAPS2 said. ""@CAPS9?!"" I was utterly shocked. ""@CAPS10, it's simply,"" @CAPS2 said gently, knowing my easy temper, ""@CAPS11 through the stages of grieving. Feel lost for a little bit, @CAPS6 then find your way back home. @CAPS7 is in your heart @CAPS3 always will be. Find a wave of joy @CAPS3 @CAPS11 with the flow. Love life, because, as you have just seen, it can be so short."" I nodded @CAPS6 didn't look at @CAPS1 sober face. @CAPS2 kissed the top of my head. @CAPS2 looked into my eyes ( I didn't dare meet the intensity of @CAPS1) @CAPS3 I knew @CAPS2 saw the reflection of the fire blazing in my watery green blue eyes @CAPS3 could see my processing @CAPS9 @CAPS2 had just told me. Then @CAPS2 left me alone to think. I needed to move on? How? Life wasn't that easy. I knew that. I opened up my note book to do some homework to get my mind off @PERSON2, @CAPS5, @CAPS3 @PERSON3. That's when I discovered a small piece of paper the size of a deck of cards. I flipped it over, showing that it was a picture. A tear leaked out of the corner of eye. It was of me @CAPS3 @PERSON2. We were both in a mud pit. My blond hair looked like dirt ( considering that I had been rolling in mud). My pit bull was rubbing @CAPS1 greasy head on my shoulder smearing more mud on to myself. I smiled, missing him even more, @CAPS6 feeling a lot better then a minute before. I loved him. I loved him so much. I still do this day, @CAPS6 I had to get over that my friend was gone. After I saw the picture, I had laughed to myself, automatically feeling better about being such a horrid granddaughter @CAPS3 a inconsiderate best friend. @CAPS6 seeing the good times we had, @CAPS3 smiling, made me honestly feel better about myself. Huh? Maybe laughter is the cure for anything.",24,21,45,"ID1,ORG1,STY1"
11841,5,"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy, enjoyable, and worth living. I say happy because they had family to be with, and other friends to help them if anything. I say enjoyable because the author talks about how they (main character) had the first birthday and first friend. I would enjoy all my birthdays if I was that person and also my first friend. I also said worth living because they had food on their table everyday. And nothing in the memoir said anything about struggling. This is why I explain the mood as happy, enjoyable, and worth living.",2,1,2,"ID3,ORG2,STY3"
3304,2,"How would you like to read or listen to something disrespecting and calling you out of your name such as, '@CAPS1 did you say to me @CAPS2'? Would you want to keep things like that in your libraries? I would, I think anything that was hurtful, harmful, or offensive should be open to the public because it's a great way and opportunity to learn.                             Books, magazines, and music on slavery are things I think we as a people required to read are things we are required to have. Sure it might hurt, depress, or even aggrivate some people but it also fills you with knowledge on the past. For a person of any race this is a way to feel the pain and struggle of people before us. Despite the pain or irritation this is a type of learning I would welcome in libraries.                             Knowledge of suicide is also something I think should be available. Because some of our friends and family have either did or attempted suicide, and without knowing about it how can it be prevented. Books on the subject would provide help for those going throughout life with suicidal thoughts. Reading about past struggles or facts about it could give them tips or ideas on how to avoid suicide. I think we need literature on this because I feel enlightenment on the subject is the only way you can avoid it.                                                                      In conclusion, I think that all types of literature should be admitted and released to the public. I think this because all forms of literature offer a great opportunity to learn. I believe that only by reading the literature on past situations and  struggles can you avoid or overcome struggles you face or will face in your lifetime",3,4,3,"ID2,ORG2,STY2"
12991,5,"In this memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, written by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso talks about how his family made his house a home. The mood he sets throughout the memoir is love, selflessness, and gratefullnes. This memoir shows love because of paragraph @NUM1, Rodriguez reminisces, ""countless extended family members came and went--and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows love because even if they weren't blood related, they still consider themselves family and cared for each other beyond belief. This memoir also has the mood of selflessness because Rodriguez says that they moved selflessly, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved and ended up facing many hardships to their new country. The last mood shown in this memoir is gratefullness. Narciso Rodriguez is grateful for his cooking abilities, his love for cuban music and for his parents love and sacrifice. Especially he is grateful for how his parents turned his simple house into a home.",4,3,4,"ID2,ORG2,STY2"

3341,2,"Libraries should have whatever they want in the library. Everyone has their on thoughts on things. If you don't like what they have on there shelfs then don't go there any more or pick up something you like. Everyone is different so you can't just take offensive stuff off the shelves, it might be offensive to one person, but not to someone else.      Materials, such as book, music, movies, magazines you can't just start taking stuff of the shelves just because there offensived you. The only way I would say take books or magazines off the shelves is if the facts are not right.       Libraries hold almost anything anybody needs materials, books, music, movies, magazines and everythings for facts. So don't start taking stuff off your shelves. Teenagers might have to write a paper about something that people think is affensive, if you don't have everything in the library then we won't have good facts. No one in this world agrees on anything, all you would be doing would be picking a fight if you taking of offensive.Libraries are open to any one that wants to read about almost anything they want to read about.       Music everybody has there on type of music you can't just start taking music of because you think it's offensive. Most people have there own type of everything.     Children is there own person you can keep them from whatever you want to, the thing is you can't hold them back in life. They get older you won't be able to tell them want to do or want not to do. If you keep them from a book or etc they might end up reading it in the long run. Keep you kids safe is inpormant I understand your kids are going to expirects things you don't want them to. Just by taking offensive stuff of the shelves doesn't mean your kids won't fine them some where else.      I could understand if the books or magazines were offensive to you because it was about your family, But of time your going to have offensive come up in your life. That means your going to have to not let it get under you skin or get over it.      Things get under people skin to easy. This is why the world don't get along. If you don't like something don't me around it. Fine something unless to read about. Thats what I do if I don't like something.",3,3,3,"ID2,ORG2,STY3"
29,1,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people throughout the world use, or own computers. Although there are @CAPS1 people who think computers are good for you, others could say different. While you are on the computer you can become more socal by talking with friends or family. Also, while you are on the computer you @MONTH1 not notice it but; your hand-eye coordination is improving, and finally, you are able to search with a click of a button, instead of searching your topic through dozens of books. Computers have very @CAPS1 benefits. One being chating, or talking online to friends, and family. You @MONTH1 have a distant friend that you haven't talked to in a while.

It is always good to have friends, and stay in touch with family. Some people find it hard to play a piano because they cannot look at the music and have their hands be doing something else.

It allows people to be socal, and talk to old friends; it also improves your hand-eye coordination, and finally; it gives you the option to search a topic without all the hastle of searching through dozens of books.

479,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some people are debating whether advances in technology, such as computers, are benefitial to our daily life. I think that computers are a good addition to life for a few reasons. For one, information and knowledge are at your fingertips. It takes merely seconds to know anything you want or need to. Email, @CAPS2, @CAPS1, etc. can be labeled as wasteful or dangerous. New friends can be made everyday. Lastly, there can be limits set so no more worrying about to much time spent on the computers. One of the reasons computers can be benefitial to our daily life is what it can give us. Knowledge is just seconds away. Anything you might be interested in learning is all on the web. Homework, school projects, and even work need information that isn't found anywhere else. The library is a great place to find what you're looking for, but if you're in a hurry and need what you're looking for quick, there is the online encyclopedia, world book, etc.Technology is becoming a huge part of our life today, many opinions are up in the air about it. If, there's one thing everyone can agree on, it's fast and can make daily tasks easier. Ordering clothes, books, movies, tickets for trips and more all can be done online. That's not all the computer has to offer. Friends/family are a necessary part of life, but they're not always living right around the corner. They @MONTH1 live on the other side of the state, country, even world! @CAPS2, @CAPS1, email, etc. can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at anytime. E-mail has been around longer than other websites like @CAPS2 and myspce which allow you to keep daily tabs on them. @CAPS1 or ichat allows you to instantely talk to anybody that you want. These websites can't replace being together in person, but it can help keep in touch for the meanwhile. Some are worried about spending too much time face to face with the screen, there is even something to prevent that. Time spent inside on the computer is becoming a problem. Not enough exersise or time spent outside can be unhealthy. Time limits can fix this problem. A certain amount of time can be plugged in. When there's @NUM1 minutes left, it gives you a warning. That way more time can be spent outside in the open, and less inside staring at the screen all day. Many different opinions about whether computers belong in our life have been shared. I believe they're a beneficial part of our life. They allow you information at the touch of your fingers, access to friends/family, plus there's time limits.

This is my people should stop being lazy and have some fresh air. @CAPS2 you people who spend time on the computer interact with their family? Well, no, because they think they will get entertain by technology instead of their family. The reason I don't like compter so much because you get hook on so fast you can't stop. When you interact will family you get to know them better and that is priceless. This is why it should stop because it damage peoples minds. Another reasons I would like you to hear is less time exercising. When people don't exercise you will @CAPS2 anything to their body. They start to eat too much and later they become very lazy. When you exercise you have tons of energy to @CAPS2 anything. Like bunge jump. When you excerise you look healthy and people will notive. This why excerise is the best healthy and always fit.

When you are on the computer you are sitting down instead going outside and that because a habit. It will be hurting are environment because people don't want to get up to enjoy nature. This is why it should not be tollerated because people are being lazy. In conclusion, the reason why people should not spend their life on computer because they think they will be entertain by technology instead of interacting will their family.

The effect on people on the computer by not knowing technology is some people think that technology is dumb because you have a brain instead of a computers have information in your brain if you are smart. Some people are poor and never had a computer or never heard technology and country some of them don't even have technology or electrion because they can't afford for a computers. The effect that they don't know technology is they can find location and no cellphone you can call your friend go online and listen to music, play games chat to friend and family. Play games with each other. And watch movies. Another effect is learning about computers and how to use it step one turn it on. Click on intert explorer and search on a website to go on it's kind of hard to use the keyboard and typing it fast. The last effect is talking to people that you don't know form online.

3405,2,"We see them. We read them. We gossip about them. Books that are found with inapropriate language, pages with the word 'sex' on them, disturbing thoughts and ideas, cuss words, its all there, but yet they are still in our libraries. My views on censorship is that, yes, our libraries should be more modest and not have books on the shelves with these things in them. The  books in libraries across the @LOCATION1 that have found and profane ideas in them, is one of the direct faults in our teenagers today.     In my personal experience with this, i have come across books that have had inapropriate language in them. I have also read books assigned to me at school that have had descriptions of sex and bad language in them as a third grader. As a young boy, I would go home to my parents and show them the content of the book and how despiteful it was. I've always been raised in a @CAPS1 home and seeing these things not only in schools, but on the bookshelves in libraries I believe is un-called for. I know that there are so many things that could offend people. Rascism, sex, cussing, rules, religion, but you need to eliminate the main things. It is impossible to please everyone. These ideas in magazines, books, in movies, and even in music has changed the world upside down. Even when I was young, we were taught no cussing aloud, and yet you see this all the time in books.     In @LOCATION2, of course we have the freedom to do what we want. Authors have the right to put profane language in their books, and even dirty ideas. However, libraries are not forced to keep this content in their libraries across the globe. I believe that we should keep the future of @LOCATION2 in the back of our minds, that if we teach them this material, they are going to grow up in the world with no morals at all, and the world will become worse than it already is.      In the quote by Katherine Paterson, I believe that she has made a strong point. If we take the books off of shelves, then our students, children, grandchildren won't be taught properly, and then there would be no education at all. However, I believe that from this quote even she agrees we in @LOCATION2 fear what our children read. So yet, why do we keep these books in our libraries? I believe that if we take these certain books, magazines, movies, songs, and internet sites off the computers, and out of libraries and schools, teenagers wouldn't be traveling down the road they are.     Today, the world has turned to a disaster. The kids we saw @NUM1 years ago were on the right path. Now those same kids are smoking pot, having sex, getting girls pregnant, abortions, miscarriages, things that are not appropriate. And I truly believe that this content students read in schools and libraries across @LOCATION2 has something to do with it all. It is now in the hands of the @LOCATION3, whether our kids grow up to be the future of @LOCATION2, or the joke of @LOCATION2. We need this fixed",3,3,3,"ID3,ORG2,STY2"

He thought he would be able to stop and get water regulary but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water.

4117,2,"In the library I have noticed that there are a few literature materials that are not suitable for a younger age group. Such as rated @CAPS1 movies that contain things like drug use, sexual content, and extreme violence. Not all libraries have movies, and the ones that do don't let anyone under the age of @NUM1 rent out a rated @CAPS1 movie. Another example would be magazines that have articles/advertisments and pictures that are more towards the sexual side. This is a problem with children because then they think that that's how they should look and act, when they are older.     Most libraries are divided up into different sections, there is a section for adults, teens, and children. The sections were created for a reason to show/tell people that some materials in this section @MONTH1 not be suitable for teens and children. Then if your in a childrens section you know that not many over the age of @NUM2 will be wanting to look around for books. In the childrens section a library normally makes it look bright and colorful which most children love. This helps the children stay there and not wonder off into one of the adult or teen sections.      When I was younger I didn't really care to go into the adult or teen sections cause I enjoyed reading 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4', '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8', and many other children books there. Children have a lot of things to satisfy them at the library there's children movies/shows like '@CAPS9 @PERSON1'. They also have an unlimited amout of books that can keep them entertained. If movies and books don't work for them then there are also a few toys they can play with (at least the libraries I've been to have toys).         The only real big problem with having things unapropriate in the library is that the younger teens might wander into the adult section, and sometimes there are adult things in the young adult section. Again with the movies, there are tv shows that I've seen at the library that are about teens doing drugs going to parties and getting drunk. Things like that I think put a bad influence on younger teens. Making them think it's okay to do drugs and drink, that it will make them more popular and cool.      Over all I think that libraries just need to reorganize there books, movies, and magazines. Then all the right items will be put in the right sections and there will be no accidents where someone accidently picks up something that is inapropitate for their age group. The music in the library I don't think is much of a problem. To me music is something more to express your feelings. This is my view on censorship in libraries",4,4,4,"ID2,ORG2,STY2"
7315,3,"The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first he is fine riding along the old-timers �shortcut� as he states that �things began well enough.

He wasn�t overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how �a far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water. He even came across a snake. He was now fearing a heat stroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused.

4719,2,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly yhe same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' states Katherine Paterson. Books and movies all over the world are being censored and removed from libraries, day after day, due to their explicit content. I believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelf, and that they are there for a genuine purpose. Explicit objects should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, children's parents have a right to exclude the material from the child's life, and some material can be useful in life and someone @MONTH1 learn from @CAPS3.      Children everywhere are being influenced by books, magazines, movies, and even songs. Some people argue that these harmful materials are affecting how kids behave and act. I, however, believe that a child should have superb morals and values to know right from wrong. For example, if a child happens to see a pornography magazine lingering on a shelf of their local grocerey store, they should know that no matter how temping @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, that buying that pornography magazine would be wrong. From birth, parents are constantly teaching their children what is right and what is wrong. They attempt to teach their children the basics: that drugs, alcohol, and smoking will corrupt their health. @CAPS3 doesn't matter if a child sees someone doing drugs in a movie or hears a song about a teenager getting drunk. They should not be influenced by this because by using their logic, they should infer that what is being read or listened to isn't always the right thing to do.     Everyday, children's parents have the right to exclude harmful material from a child's life. After all, they are a superior figure in the child's life, and the child will always look up to them to lead the way. At most local theaters now, you have to be seventeen to see a rated '@CAPS1' movie. A lot of theaters allow a child to view a rated '@CAPS1' movie, no matter what age, as long as they have a parent or a gardian present. Movie theaters feel that by having a child's parent there would help immensly because the parent is choosing for their child to watch that particular movie, instead of the child viewing the movie without their permission. If a parent doesn't want their child to view a raunchy movie, they can simple say, 'NO!' @CAPS3's as simple as that. If a parent feels that a movie is decent for a child to watch, then go ahead and let them watch that material. Parental agreement should always be a main factor in determined whether or not a child could view a particular movie or read a certain provacative book.      If all offensive books and movies were removed from the shelf, we would be living in a structured world where no one would learn any more than what they already knew. Life @MONTH1 possibly become rather boring. Although, some people @MONTH1 find books and songs to be offensive, others @MONTH1 contribute from these materials. A child @MONTH1 pick up a book, start reading, and discover some disturbing thoughts that they never would have encountered beyond picking up that book. They would never of learned such things. Reading information like this, creates a move advanced society. Adults and children are becoming smarter each day. Any parent would agree that they would love any opprotunity to arise for their children to become smarter and more wiser than they already were. Songs, movies, books, and magazines could provide that for their child. Reading is an escape from a jungle of wild monkies for some children. They @MONTH1 use a book to get away from the struggles of everyday life and get lost within its lively pages. If more and more books are being censored and thrown out, that equates to less books a child could have an opprotunity to discover. I once read that even @CAPS4 classes all over the world are not allowing their students to read The @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 @CAPS7. The teachers find this book to be too inappropriate for their students. This is unfair for any student, because this novel is inspiring and life changing, so they are definitely missing out. Also, movies and songs are provided for one's pure entertainment, so @CAPS3 shouldn't always matter if its crude. A child or young adult @MONTH1 learn things that they never thought imaginable through provided public materials.     In conclusion, books, magaizines, movies, and music are one's individual way of expressing themself. They should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, parents have the right to exclude offensive material from a child's life, and material, not matter how crude @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, can be used as a learning tool. If more and more material is being removed from our local libraries, @CAPS3's almost like authors are being punished for being unique. Our children won't be exposed to as much, therefore, they won't learn and grow from @CAPS3. Do you really want our society to prohibit intelectual thinking just because they think certain material @MONTH1 be offensive? Think about @CAPS3",5,5,5,"ID1,ORG1,STY1"

Computers allow the everyday family to see new places, through photos online, and people, through the internet. Computers also provide a social networking throught a community, state, or even a country! Lastly, a computer is another resort to go to when trying to accomplish something, because there is always something on the internet that will help you. There's a famous quote that goes, ""the largest room in the world, is the room for improvement."" In my opinion, the computers could make that room a little smaller. While experts say that computers are making people spend too much time indoors, and not too much time seeing the wonders of nature outside, the computer can prove them wrong.

If you just put the pictures on a social networking system, like facebook, or twitter, memories will be stored through, litterally, the clicks of aborton. Memories are shared thanks to the social networking ability of the computer. Planing a vacation is a trough job to do, but what if that job could all take place in our sport? An entire vacation can be planned, confirmed and paid for thanks to the computer. Jobs that would normally take hours of researching and calling can be done in @DATE1 minuets for less using the computer.

I remember when a new came to our school from he wasn't that kid and didn't many friends he was still doing just fun but when he came back the next year started and I found out he had at the end of he school and keep in touch with an of his friend and to his parents. So far that week of from the rest of the students and don't much. Then the we got back the @DATE1 he wasn't at school and for the rest of the week he didn't show up either and finaly on @DATE2 and teachers told us he ran away from and has still not been found. So people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends which can cause them to become depressed and lonely. More and more people are using computers daily basis, but I do not agree that this is benefiting our society. People are spending to much in their computers and are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends. I know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse.",5,4,9,"ID2,ORG1,STY2"

I think he felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to help him. Also the long hilly highway with nothing but desert on either side basically gave him the discouraging feeling that that road was never going to end and there was no way out of what he had started. I think it made him feel trapped and it was so dry that there was no water in sight and it made him feel so much thirstier than he was. Overall I think that it had really physical and psycoligical effects on him. ,2,2,2,"ID2,ORG3,STY3"

This is why I think computers are very positive. Certainly, people can learn about far away places on the computer. Say, someone wanted to take a trip to @LOCATION1 they can look it up, learn the launage. They can by tickets. They could also find interesting things to see in that country. These reasons are why I think a computer is a positive technology. My next reason I think a computer is positive toward people is that people can comuicate online. This can help keep families in touch. It can help you find and talk to old friends (facebook). You can even make new friends to talk to. These are other examples why I think computers are positive. My last reason I think computer have a positive affect on people is that it can help you with jobs. It can help you find a job. It can also help you with your job. Lastly, it can have you have a higher position at your job. These are my reasons I think computers are important and positive to people.

I guess it was just in the way she said I saved her life. I'm glad @PERSON1 sits next to me in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. With out her, it would be so boring.

But there are some big downsides to this box of information. Such as, this gadget is taking over peoples lives and keeping them from excersizing. Now a days, people are even loosing human interaction from these marvelous toys. And finally, computers are very expensive electronics, they have much up keep which costs you money ultimately making you depressed. As you can see, although there are some great pros to computers, there are also pretty big downfalls that you havn't thought of yet. As I previously stated, computers are taking away from people excersicing. We're all becoming quite lazy. People rather stay at their computer screens playing grand theft auto or facebook stalking than going outside to play a game of soccer with your friends at the empty field down the street. @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 goes without physical domain for at least a @DATE1 and a half. @PERCENT2 of those people rather just tay at home on their computers. This is a disgrace! We cannot let this continue. We must change the way we live and get rid of this unhealthy appliance we call a computer. Of all my reason that computers are bed, this is by far the most disturbing. People are having less, and less human interactions as computers become more popular. Now you, can d everything from your computer. Soon people will be marrying them. Oh wait, that's already happened. Just yesterday, I read in the newest issue of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 that a man married a character in his computer game. There was a priest present and everything. They just recently got back from their honeymoon. This is sad! Look at what our world has become. People rather marry a computer character than actually communicate with real people. We must act quick, I don't know what will happen next. Finally, computer cost a lot of money. You pay @MONEY1 for the computer outright, but then you have all the up keep and there is lots of up keep. Computers are very troublesome. You just keep pouring money into it, which is just depressing. It will just break again soon or freeze and cause you to loose a report you've worked on all night. For example, @DATE1 my dad had to pay @MONEY2 in order to get my @DATE1 computer unbugged. He was so reluctant to even pay it and afterwards he was annoyed all week for even-paying it.

1104,1,"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 of the most important inventions of the past decades is the computer, and it has its pros and cons. I think people spend to much time on computers, especially teenagers. They spend to much time on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, and not enough time outside enjoying nature and playing sports or exercising. While they @MONTH1 talk with friends with @CAPS4, it is not the same as going to the park with friends and playing a game of baseball. Families also are distant form each other when they sit around on @CAPS5. Teenagers spend too much time on the @CAPS6 going where they should instead of doing more benefitul activities like reading. I sure we all know at least @CAPS1 obese person or teenager. My neighbor is the size of a killer whale and eats just about as much as @CAPS1. He will sit on the computer chair and stare with his eyes glazed at the computer chair and stare with his eyes glazed at the computer screen for hours on end. Sometimes I wonder how many brain cells he wastes per second. I will bet that everyone who reads this knows someone like my neighbor. The statistic @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2 is obese is not exagrated at all. In my opinion, it is the fault of the @CAPS6 and computers. Instead of going to the gym or the soccer field with friends, they got to the computer and talk and eat junk food. They spend their time watching pointless @CAPS5 videos, while they should be playing baseball or football. Doubters say you learn hand-eye cordination with computers, but you can learn better with sports. Computers are a large factor in obesity because they encourage @CAPS1 to sit around instead of doing standard @NUM1 minutes a day of exercise. The next pressing issue is the amount of reading the average teenager and @CAPS9 does. I would say that the average gets about @NUM2 minutes of reading a day because they are to busy chating with friends on the @CAPS6. I have a cousin who reads about a book every @NUM3 years and fail every test he gets and has stayed back @NUM4 times, but instead of reading and learning, he is chating and texting. He wastes these excellent educational opportunitys while their are people in underdevolped countries like @LOCATION3 who are lucky to own a book. I know more than @PERCENT2 of the kids in my class do not read anything execpt the required reading and that is because they sit around on the computers wasting @CAPS10 is about @NUM5 and that number is decreasing because of the lack of reading done and the time on computers spent. I have seen survey that say @NUM6 out of @NUM7 spend more than @NUM6 hours a day on computers. These statistics and quotes have left me thinking, how much time do we really need to spend on computers instead of reading or else we will turn into oversized monkey who can't even rad. The computers and @CAPS6 are doing more than just erasing brain cell and are health, they are taking away the expriences that we could have outside in nature.

We should be preserving and learning abouy what is left on the planet, but we are not because of these computes and the @CAPS6.

Let's say a person wanted to read a book about the fall of the wall of @LOCATION1, the library says they do not and will not carry such reading history, the person will be angry even though they can find the book somewhere else but they should still be able to find that book in that library.

This is not due to the lack of funding or even the quality of teachers and staff. No neither of these problems is the cause behind many student's inabiltiy to compose thought provoking essay and analysis over a myrad of topics. This is due to the extremes in censorship that are being placed on libraries and schools in general. Many of the relevent topics and materials need to truely understand our constantly changing world is being removed from the grasp of those who will go on to lead this new world.Some prime examples of this tyrany on knowledge is the removal of books suck as @PERSON1, @PERSON2, the @CAPS1, and many other classical works. Each of these according to many parents has good reason to be removed from our libraries. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 promotes discrimination and racial supremacy along with being written by what @CAPS3 has pegged as one of the humanity's most vile of creatures. @PERSON2 uses racial surrs that are not appropriate to be in the hands of our young children. The @CAPS1 violates the separation of church and state. Many other classical works refference racism, drugs, murder, sex and use rampant profanity. All of these are valid reasons as to why a parent @MONTH1 advocate for there to be censorship of our libraries.These reasons, as well meaning as they @MONTH1 be, are no longer good enough to be valid in todays changing environment. Many of the books that have been recomneded to be removed show us an unfiltered view of a time period from a point of view that did not belong to the 'victor' of the social battle. As we know, '@CAPS3 is written by the victors.' @CAPS4 it is good that the @CAPS5 won the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and helped abolish slavery it is still important to realize that we still cannot remove the view point from our centers of knowledge. To forget is to remember at another time. That time is when we repeat the same mistakes again.For the parents who also want to save the innocence of their children by forbidding these books from libraries need to realize that the media has been pumping these forbiden images to their children more than books have. To censor our libraries is to cripple our children from the knowledge they need to fully understand our shadowed and fragmented world.

Laughter is something incredible in the world of human existence, it is something that relieves awkward situations, brings people together, and makes life a little bit easier. Laughter is something that everyone shares in common. Some people find laughter in different things than others but still we can all laugh together. Many times in my life has laughter helped me through tough situations, brought me close to someone, and just made life more enjoyable.   I remember once I was trying out for a volleyball team. It was the first day of tryouts and I was really nervous because I didn't know anyone. I had never even heard of these people and now I was going to be competing against them. There was one thing I knew about them though. It was that we all shared a common goal of making the team and being successful. Tryouts began and I felt like they were wondering why I was even there, but I ignored them and just kept working hard. Tryouts went okay for the rest of the week but still something just didn't feel right. I still felt like I didn't belong there. It was the last day of tryouts and the girls had warmed up a little, but I still felt a little uncomfortable. After the last practice it was time to announce the teams. I was really nervous cause what if I didn't make it? Or what if I did, but everyone hated me on the team? He announced the names and I was beginning to give up hope when he said my name. I was so excited, but the girls seemed to be annoyed by my name getting called. When I got home I told my parents and they were excited for me. I then told them how I didn't really know anybody and kind of felt like an outsider. They asked me if I had tried talking to anyone, and I said no not really they didn't try talking to me so I thought why should I? My mom then told me that I could only get to know them if put myself out there. I thought about it and realized I really hadn't. I ignored them as much as they ignored me. I also wasn't myself, because I really am a cool person and I am fun to be around, I just for some reason I crawled into a shell this time. I decided the next day at practice I would put myself out there. The next practice I showed up and was partnered up with a girl named @PERSON1. It was so awkward and at first we were just quiet passing the ball back an forth. Then I started talking to her and making jokes she laughed and I laughed and we had a great time. The rest of the practice went great. The awkward moments faded away into laughter. We all worked hard and joked around with each other, laughed, and I really felt like we were bonding. They laughter had brought us together. All this time it felt like we were so far away and different and really it wasn't like that at all. Having fun and laughing together showed us how much we had in common and that we were all the same. I believe that day that laughter brought our team together.  I will never forget that day. It was the day I learned how important laughter was in a relationship, getting to know someone, and how well it brings people together. That season of volleyball I made many new friends. I also learned a valuable lesson that and awkward situation can always be turned around by laughter. Today I still talk to those girls on the team and still today we all laugh together, just because you known someone for a while doesn't mean the fun and laughter has to fade away, because I believe it should get stronger.

The mast couldn't just be dropped on, however because if a dirigibles were to the moored there, it would put too much stress on the building's framework. This revelation caused them to have to modify the entire framework to make it stronger which was very expensive.Another difficulty the builder's faced, after construction was completed, in allowing dirigibles to dock there was nature.

Firstly, spending hours and hars on the computer gives you no social skills what on ever. You could think before you reply and most people online talk or write way differently there then in person. People could act like someone else. Online you could erase what you wrote but in person you can't. Thats way you simply can't gain social skills sending all this time talking online. Next, you get no exercises. On a nice beautiful @DATE1 you'll be inside on the computer when you could be getting exercise. Being on line sitting down doing nothing just talking makes you lazy.

Finally, its addicting some people could good hours and hours on the computer looking up all these videos. Seven out of ten teenagers rather be inside in the computer talking to people rather then meeting new people elsewhere. I think parents should restrict their children's time to be on computers.

Three of the main obsticles they faced where there was a lack of suitble landing area, they would have to reconstruct the building's framework, and there was a law against it. The Dirigibles are enormous steel framed balloons, that have envelopes of cotton fabric. They are also filled with hydrogen and Helium to make them lighter and float eayser. As a result of the Dirigibles being so large, some over one thousand feet, there was really no place for them to land. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state Buildings flat roof, it would add to much stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obsticle being faced was they would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars to the building's framework just so the building could support the Dirigible. The third obsticle faced was there was a law agianst it. It claimed that there would be no airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they did build a landing area, and spend the sixty thousand dollars on the building's framework they wouldnt be able to use them because of the law. Even though the idea of having a dirigible dock on the Empire State building the obsticles too face were to great for the builders with the lack of a sutible landing area, the reconstructing of the framework, and the law agianst aircrafts flying to low.",4,4,4,"ID3,ORG2,STY2"
