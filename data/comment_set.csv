3769,2,"My views are that if it is offensive to someone or other people the certain maeterial shouldn't be taken off the shelf. I think you should have to have permission from a parent, or guardian if the material is explicit. For example in a store where you buy cd's, games ect... you have to be of age to buy the material that should be the same with books.          Say a book has a certain word on it like '@CAPS1' it shouldnt be taken off the shelf just because of its name. That brings up the subject don't judge a book by its cover. Just because the name isn't to someones standards it shouldn't matter. Pick the book up read the back and see what it's actualy about. Then if it's what you was exspecting it to be talk to someone who is in charge, and explain top them what the problem is in your case.     Also you could always have a section of the store, or librarie just for adults only. It @MONTH1 sound stupid, but it can actualy help out alot. There is tons of books out there that have things in them not appropriate for children. Such as love books, they talk about love, and passion in ways that are very innappropriate for children.      If there was a section of a store or librarie it could help keep these things out of your children, or other childrens minds. You or anyone else wouldnt have to worry about children picking certain material up that you wouldn't want them to see. Just keep this in mind next time your in a librarie and you see something you wouldn't like for your children to see",3,3,,3,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID1,ORG2,STY1"

3548,2,"Do I believe that vertain materials should be removed from the shelves of libraries if found offensive? I believe that all types of materials should be placed in libraries to satisfy the different styles of what people like. Censorship should not play a role because everyone has their own opinions on what is looked at as offensive and what is not. By giving everyone the freedom to enjoy what they like will make alot of people happier.      The wants and needs of people varie from one extreme to the other. What one person loves, another @MONTH1 hate. This should not play a role in whether or not materials should be removed from public places such as a library. Everyone has the right to express themselves through art in their own way. Taking away the art that some find offensive would not be fair to those who enjoy it. By doing this, not all people will be satisfied when not everyone gets what they want.     Censorship should not take part in any library. Entertainment can not always please everyone. It will be judged in many ways no matter what anyone has to say, so the problem should just be left alone. Arguing to take away the material that some like will only cause tension to rise and make matters worse. It is understandable, for example, that a parent would not want their child to be able to be welcomed into the media world where not everything has postive influences. That's life though and not everyone has th same outlook on it. You have to think of others, and respect their view of it all as well.     Opinons will vary with what I have had to say. I strongly believe that people should be given the right to enjoy the materials they take an interest in. Censorship definitely has its positives and negatives, but for the most part it is wrong and should not have a role in any library. Cutting down people's availability to their interests will only lead to frustration. You can not please everyone, so in that case, censorship will just have to be looked beyond.",3,3,,3,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID2,ORG2,STY2"

I do not think that certain materials should be removed for many reasons. Many different people have many different thoughts on whats offensive and what isn't like some people will find something funny that some people @MONTH1 think is nasty or inapropiate. If you was to take things off the shelves that someone found offensive there probably wouldn't be much left on the shelves because everybody has they're own oppenion. I agree that certain things shouldn't be seen by young eyes but thats the parents decision, not everyone has the same view on the material.

4761,2,Offensive things should be taken off for many reason that will be explained later on. Things in magazines shoud be appropriate for people to see. The first reason why they should be removed from the shelves is it might be offending to someone important like the president of the @ORGANIZATION1 or the @CAPS1 of your state.      If the subjects in the reading material are offensive to someone they should say something to defend themselves. If they don't speak up no one will think to change anything.     What I don't understand is why people would let that ridiculous stuff be put in the magazines and music and movies anyway.Even though movies are kind of different. Movies are mostly just made up ideas that people come up with. So if people are offended it is just pretend to begin with.      Offending things in books well the author probably has a reason for it. It might be something that is offending yet people need to know this in case it has to do with someone you know.For example in the Newspaper I read an article about our current president. @PERSON1 was being question about his birth certificate. People did not believe that he was born in @LOCATION1.      I personally think he was in fact born in the @CAPS2.S . But of course they did see his certificate that proved he was a member so that mess should be dropped and forgotton. It was uncalled for to begin with.     I wonder what was going through his head when someone asked him that question. I'm sure someone would have seen it before he even became president.,3,3,,3,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID3,ORG2,STY2"

In a survey taken in @CAPS2 magazines @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT1 of people, have negative effects with computers. Inmy opinion, I think comuters have a negative effect on people. First, people are not interacting with family and friends. @CAPS1 is very important to have interactions with people. When on the computer your not really interacting with. You just sit there staring at a screen. In a survey taken at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and not interacting with the people around them. Parents don't se etheir kids as much because they are always on the computer. Parents would love to see their kids move. Interacting with their family and friends will be healthy to them. Computers take the away fromhanging out with family and friend. Secondly, people don't get to enjoy nature. People on computer might go outside because they are involved with the computer. Stay in one room doing the thing for books for a @CAPS5 in a while people need fresh air. too but learning about nature is more nature. If you dont enjoy nature you dont know what is going on.NAture is all around us and why would you miss out on. in a survey taken in a local magazine @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and. While people enjoy computer, nature. Lastly, people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising. Exercise is important for the mind and body. Our bodies need to stay healthy and fit. The lack of exercise is increasing fast. The more people get computers the people exercise. America is over weight already to join the People on computers most just long to become over weight. People rather play on computer that got exercise for a healthy body. Dr. @DR1 a local doctor, has seen more people become over weight and not exercise as much as they used to. He says computers do not provide exercise. He recommends that people use their computers less computers are doing more. In conclusion, I think computer negative effect on.

647,1,"Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benifit the society. Computers help use in many ways but the @NUM1 main reasons are they help us store important documents get better at or learn forein language and get information. So without further adue here is more extensive reasonings. First of all, computers help us store many documents without computers companies that involve autioning and many other thing would have to store everything in filing cabinets. That would take forever and there wouldn't be enough room, so a lot of files would @CAPS1 be laying around every where @CAPS1 think about it. You use computers to make store send your newpaper articles and without computers you wouldn't be able to keep everybody up to date. Secondly they help use learn on get better at forien languages. Computers help use learn what other people are saying in other countries around the world. Like I have grandmother she the learned spanish. Now I can talk to her and she can understand me. Finally computers help use get information. They help us get information for a project at school, records direction, etc. In the year @DATE1 people din't have computers but when the first router was made the people I went up @NUM2 points. Farmers became slaves became very rich and I kid even grad collage at age @NUM3. So before you say people are spending too much fine on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends think about what computers do for us @CAPS1 think. So furher more computers benifit us a lot. There's storing deviced helping us get better a lot learning a forign language and getting information.

My father never turned on a computer in his life and his buisness is doing fine. My father and his father has all of their records in a safe. One of my fathers friends had everything on his computer. When a virus hit it all of his files were gone and along with his records. My father handwrites all of his papers. He says if i need to type something out i'll buy a type writer. Also on things like facebook someone can see everything that another is doing. This is were alot of people pose as someone eles and thus @CAPS2 people get kidnapped or killed. A very good reason is that when people have alot of personal information when a virus hitls that person knows everything about you that you put on.

Not every one agrees that computer are benefitsal for the society. The positive effect and negative effect that computers have on people. My resson for supporting this @CAPS1 that computer are good or bad are that computers have a positive effect on people. The second @CAPS1 is to be able to talk to other people on line. The last @CAPS1 I have is Spending more time with family than on the computer. The first resson that i have for computers is how they have for computers is how they have positive effect on people. The examples that I have to Support this @CAPS1 are that computers tech hand eye coordination, computers given people the ability to Learn about far way place and peop. The second resson that I have on computers is that you talk to people online. The examples that I have to support my @CAPS1 are the website that kids us to talk to their friends like myspace and facebook. The place that kid like to go to are tutube and even blogging about everything and everyone. Some of theis thing can be good if you don't post picture or other this on your myspace or facebook. I think that these website are dangers because somebody can hack in to your file and they can try to talk to you like their your friend. The third resson I have to support my @CAPS1 is that we should spend more time with our family than being on the computer the whole time I have example on want we should do with or familys instead of being on the computers I have some @CAPS1 of games that we can play with our familys instead of being on the computers, The games that we can play with our familys are monopoly, somy, canda landy card, video games, we can also talk to our family instead of talking to our friends the whole time. When we can injoy want we have in live not just with computers but with our family. Inconclusion I am statting my opinion that the more time people spend on computers than with their own family.

4514,2,"Should books be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Who would determine if something is offensive or not and to whom it offends? These are just two questions that can create a high level of conflict and issues among many people. Would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view?      First of all, who decides what is offensive and who it offends? It is possible for anything to offend anyone.  Also removing a book from the shelves could be offensive to the writter and the followers of the writter. Bringing up removing a book from shelves could cause more problems then just letting the book remain on the shelves. If offending others is the issue then would it not be better to leave it alone over all, rather than making it an issue to please one group but inturn upsetting another?      Secondly, could removing a book from the shelves limit your ability to learn something or hear something from another point of view? If books that offended people would have always been removed for reasons of offending other we could not have much of the knowledge we have today. For example a biology book might be offensive to people whos religion explains things differently and would make things untrue, and a religous document such as 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3' could be offensive to the people who believe the biology books to be true. If we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive, we would not have religion or modern science. This example could be used for any topic or genre of book because people can take many different things as offensive.      As a solution,  I believe it true that it is not possible to please everyone. If one person is pleased another is offended. If that person is pleased then the first person is offended. If books could possibly labeled as'some might take offensive' or 'material @MONTH1 be offensive' then people have a warning and they can choose if they want to read it or not. If they are offended they can not put blame on the author or where ever they got the book because there was a warning. It would  be just like the parental warnings on cd's. This @MONTH1 not fix the problem of people being offended, but it could very much reduce the amount of complaints about a book being offensive.     In conclusion, books should just be left on the shelves regardless of people complaining about them being offensive. Books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning. That is just not an opition. Leaving books that offend certain people on the shelves @MONTH1 cause contraversy with others but if some sort of warning could be put in place and the proper procedures are preformed, the issues should decrease greatly.

People in library fight over a sigle book. I think who ever gets there first should get the book, but that just me. If two people fight over a book they should be kicked out of the library and never come back to the library. And that is why we have fights over a book. The next time you are in a library think frist before you act. Ask yourself '@CAPS3 they get ther before me?'.          The library should have more that one copy of a book. Lets say '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1' book sreies is in the library and thay have one of each book. Now the lat move of '@ORGANIZATION1' is coming out this @DATE2 (@DATE1) and people what the last book to read. The kids what it, but there is one book. So what do you do? Get more copies of the book. This is why libraries should have more than one copy.          If the libraries don't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums. If they have one copy of a book it will begin fights. You don't what to fight in a library (look @CAPS4 @NUM1). Now if it was me, I will let someone have it that whan it.

I feel strongly that libraries should have every differnt kind of book for anyone. Everyone goes to a library so i think it should be an open library and have all different kinds of books. If a kid or a teenager is trying to get an adult book someone of age should have to come their and check the book out for them.      I think that libraries are for everyone in a community and that not everyone reads and looks at good nice books some look at naughty books and they should have the right to go and check out books like that. When you go to a library you should be able to go their and get whatever genre that you want and their be no restrictions.      I think that the only restriction that should be made is the age limit on naughty adult books or novels and if they are very bad then they should be behind the desk and you have to be of age to get it.      My conclusion is, if you are going to look at all kinds of books they should have no restrictions on what you look at.

4033,2,"As @CAPS1, we are entitled to both freedom of speech and freedom of the press.  However, these rights are somewhat suppressed in the censorship of media at libraries.     I can understand why libraries feel that they need to ban certain works; there are many children that frequent libraries, and having explicit content could deter parents from allowing them to visit.  Surely, though, the media in question could be placed in a seperate area, off-limits to anyone under a certain age.  Even if someone gets their hands on one of these works, safeguards could be used at the front desk to keep them from borrowing the material.  Their library card would show their age, and the worker would not allow them to check out the work if they were too young.     Furthermore, I trust in people's common sense.  If they believe that a book or movie will be too adult for them, they will avoid checking it out of the library.  Parents, as well, will surely not allow their children to borrow risque material.  Information is open to those that search for it, and the knowledge it brings prevents unwanted results.     There are those that want this content banned because it does not conform to their morals, but this is really just setting restrictions on other's freedoms.  They @MONTH1 think it is too explicit, but another @MONTH1 not.  That other person might want to use the material, but because of restrictions set by the first person, the borrowing of the work becomes prohibited.  It seems that if the first doesn't agree with the material, they could just let it be, and not bring others into the dispute.  People know their limits and generally make sure they don't cross them.     I think this conflict represents the @CAPS2 way of life in itself.  When a disagreement arises, no matter what the topic, one group of people wants to basically control what everyone else can or cannot do.  They organize protests, sign petitions, etc. True, people do protest laws, and with good reason.  However, there really is no need to argue over petty issues that could easily be avoided if people were to just use common sense to reach a consensus.  I think this censorship issue is a prime example of that.     When it comes to these kinds of debates, we need to learn that we can't be too quick to place restrictions; that we should leave others to do what they think is best for themselves.  The best course of action is to leave others alone concerning simple things such as this, and to avoid placing any restrictions on anyone's works, rights, and freedom.  To paraphrase @ORGANIZATION1, I @MONTH1 not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death your right to say it.",5,5,,5,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID1,ORG1,STY1"

3470,2,"Censorship in Libraries.                                                                           Censorship is a big conflict in many libraries. @CAPS2 are plenty of offensive books that shouldn't be put on the shelves.  Many schools call these books, magazines, and movies, '@CAPS1.'  @CAPS2 is often a week where people read all of the books that have been @CAPS1 from school libraries.  I participate in this school wide challenge beacause I disagree with banning books.  Banning books can be good and also very hurtful in many reasons.     First off, I like to think of banning books or anything else from the author or writers view.  How would you feel if you spent around @NUM1 years writing this story/movie for kids that got @CAPS1 in the first couple of weeks it was on the shelves.  I don't think that many people would enjoy that.  I also think that many people don't think of authors at that big of a deal.  When I think of that it makes me think of all the things we couldn't read in our world. Including, newspapers, books, and magizines.  Maybe even include the fact that it takes a lot of work to write the things on what people want to hear, or see.  I feel like when books or movies get @CAPS1 or removed, it makes the author feel like they're worth nothing.  The parents point of view makes things a lot worse.      Think of it this way, your child comes home from school with this book that he/she wants you to read with him.  You sit down and start reading, when suddenly you come across a violent or inappropriate secne in the story.  You stop reading all of a sudden and look at your child who is enjoying this violence and loving this story!  What do you do?             Many parents would call the school and explain what happened and complain about banning this book and taking it away from children that could get this book.  Taking it away has no point because just banning it from the school library doesn't mean that they can't find it elsewhere.  How do you think your child would feel having loved this story now it's gone?  I know that it would make me feel like I did something wrong.  Taking things off shelves also has a good side to it.      When you take the book, movie or magizine off the shelf it is gone forever from that library.  This can be a good thing because then kids won't have the obvious reason to get the story.  If you don't want your child or other children to see it then it is quite a good idea.  It makes the @CAPS1 object harder to find and also harder for the kids to grab intrest to.  If the book or movie isn't around then they won't want to read the next one or see the next movie. @CAPS2 are many different views on censorship, which could effect how people choose what happens in libraries.     My view on this topic was negitive and I support that fully.  If the author works hard on writing the story they shouldn't get punished for expressing their feelings in a story. Many different poeple come across this issue and @CAPS2 are many different views on the topic.  Next @CAPS1 book week I'll be supporting the authors that got crushed by their work getting @CAPS1.

They pick up alot of stuff when there young so your like a role model for them.      I believe that older teens like @NUM1 and @NUM2 are more mature about this, if they read a book in the library that might have a bad word. Im sure they hear it all the time on the bus or when your in town. They going to hear it anyways so why try to stop it when there going to end up hearing it. Books are suppose to help you and give you the real thing. You can't just throw out books or censor them. Everybody has there different opinion and this is my opinion. When you get at a certain age you start to mature and realize those are bad things to say or do so I believe high school books or magazines or anything else shouldn't be censored",3,3,,3,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID2,ORG2,STY2"

This quote made me visualize the scene, and I felt happy to think about the beautiful and enjoyable setting. Secondly, it made me feel loving to my loved ones like my family and friends. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance,..."" I love my family, and would be thankful if they tried to take their home country to the United States (if they were born somewhere else) with them.

4101,2,"Throughout history there have been many books written at a time in history when their beliefs on certain things differed from what our world today believes. Things that have changed as our world has changed are the views on slavery, womens rights, religion, and many other things. These views are based on what most people of a time frame believed. I feel that just because something someone wrote or said offends someone, does not give people the right to ban that book or quote from society as a whole. They have the right to ban it from themselves, but it is up to each individual whether or not it is banned for everyone.      Our government gives us the right to have freedom of speech. This shows that even though someone @MONTH1 write or speak out against the majority opinion, they can say whatever they want without being punished for it. This means that people can not just ban something for what it might say or portray. In my life explicit music seems to be something that some people are trying to ban. My parents believe that I am at the right age that I should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music I want to.      I feel that public libraries can set age restrictions on items based off language, nudity, and other inappropriate things for children just as movie theaters do, but they do not have the right to ban books. Even though there is an age restriction, as long as the guardian of the child direct says it is fine if his/her child @MONTH1 check out the book or the parent checks out the book for the child, then it is fine that that child gets that book. The choice for what is appropriate for that each child should be left up to their parents.      If libraries had to ban books because someone said that a certain book or magazine was offensive, then a library would have very few to no books. In almost all of books someone @MONTH1 be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else. These books that offend people should be kept on the shelf so that people can understand how society's views on things were back in the time period that the book was written. These items in libraries that are found offensive shows us what was wrong with society at that time and helps us learn from past mistakes in history and how to avoid them. For example, in the play A @ORGANIZATION1 it shows how the society's view of women was. It showed that they did not think highly of women and how there purpose in life were to raise the children and that was it. They did not feel that they had the intellect to talk about science or anything like that. This indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today.       If libraries start to ban books, music, movies, magazines or other items then they are hiding things they do not want people to read. Libraries should not be able to ban something because it is offensive, but they have the right to put age restrictions on certain things. Authors and artists have freedom of speech to say whatever they want and libraries can not take that away from them",4,4,,4,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID1,ORG1,STY2"

Good, because people start to read better after reading a lot, and bad because a lot of people dislike to read.     I think that when you go in a library there should be impropet books for people to read. Children go in library's, what if they pick up a bad book and form horriable habits? Children, and adults have very different views on what to read. Kids want to read fairytale stories, etc. Adult's on otherhand enjoy mystery storys about murder, and such.     Yes, library's can let people check out any book they find interesting; But, what if that book is bad for there children to see lying around. It's simple if you make sure you don't leave your books just lying anywhere, kid's wouldn't form bad habits, or discover anything there not suppose to know. Kid's are noises, and they will try to read your books, or see something bad on a magizine.     In library's, there is the children's section, and the adult section. That helps in some way's, but your child can still find that bad book, etc at home. Parents can keep from this for the safety of there childrens thought's, or qeustions about that certain book, etc that they found. It's good to just put thing's away when your done, and keep every bad book, etc out of your childs react.     Books are bad, and good. You can find the information you need, or something you really don't want to read about, or see. Books have stuff that we sometime's need to know, and want to know more about. If your kid finds a misleading book, make sure they didn't read it, or look at it; and just hide it away from them.

1665,1,"Dear @CAPS1, Advances in computer technology have positively affected the society we live in today. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help kids learn inside and outside of school, and connect the world socially. These amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation. In fact, they have done quite the opposite. Computers are an excellent way of teaching hand-eye coordination. People who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant. This is not the case. The coordination gained from using the mouse games over to sports like baseball and lacross. Players have to look at an incoming ball, and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball. As you can see, coordination is essential to sports. It is also needed for simple every day tasks around the house. These could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals. We overlook the fact they easy jobs like these still require coordination. A misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess. W are lucky that we live in a world with such a good teacher of hand-ey coordination. Computers are the worlds most knowledgeable teachers. No matter how hard you try if you are using a computer, you will learn something. The internet is a best cache of information. In the current day and age, the environment is a growing concern. Paper no made from trees, so must be cut down. It takes forty years for a tree to grow, and seconds to cut one down. Schools everywhere should use computer and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil. Since most students are familiar with computers, they enjoy working with them more than writing. The average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would whole day at school. The transiton needs to be made. Computers are also a massive social network. Instant messaging and @CAPS2 are now primary sources of communication. If it hasn't for computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friend that moved to @LOCATION2 two years ago. This is just one example of how social networks are helpful. They help people stay connected with old friends, and work. All major corporations use computers to invest, sell products, and store information. Computers are the ultimate way communicate. Obviously, computers are growing exponentially in popularity. The @LOCATION1 should put this to use. Imagine a more eco-friendly country where we don't have to cut down a million acres of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 rainforest every year.

Also, due to advancement in technology, computers are very helpful because they help @LOCATION4 with our daily lifes. Many doubts about the computer exist, but the computer can surpass all of them. In a time crunch situation like college or high school, speed is everything. Computers allow students to research faster, and with more accuracy by being able to search for key words. Before, students would have to do the painstaking process of searching in books. More times than not, they wouldn't find what they were looking for, but with the modern age, students can get the information they need fast. Also, having computers in the classroom helps so that teachers can get the info they need for an upcoming class. If speed is what you need, then you will look for a computer. Besides speed, computers also give you another great thing, communication. With emails, @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and blogs, knowing what your friends are doing later is just a click away! This is much easier than calling the person. Also having this access to friends can help when one moves away.

If we @CAPS9't want them to read or to even hear them I think the censorship is a great thing in ways.     I believe if the censorship was to go away in some forms, I would use a different method of a censorship that was a bit more on the more favored sides for adults. The censorship would still be at the library in a certain form. There would be something just a bit different or new about whatever that person is checking out.      If we could, when people are checking out these books, movie, magazines, etc. we could use a rating just like movies do. When a child whom is @NUM1 comes to the library to check out an item and they find one they are interested in they could bring it to the librarian and the librarian would check the rating and the age of the child with there library card and see if that item is appropriate for that child. There could be many ratings @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @NUM2, and @CAPS3. I think ages @NUM3 are for the @CAPS1-@CAPS2, the ages @NUM4 are for the @NUM2 and ages @NUM6 and up for rated @CAPS3.      I see many times when children are learning words, phrases, and actions from movies, books, etc. that make them think it is ok to do or say these things. I think not. In my opinion I think that this idea could help out our youth and there parents make better choices in the content they are submitting themselves to. So if you feel like this is a good idea contact your local library and tell them you are in favor of the @CAPS7,  '@CAPS7 @CAPS8.' @CAPS9't wait until you have forgotten, call now.",3,3,,3,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID2,ORG2,STY2"
4491,2,"Throughout history their have always been those who have refuted the beliefs and ideals of others. Whether that be in @LOCATION1 when statues were censored by removing anything deemed offensive by the @CAPS1 church or the mass burning of books to preserve ideals that could invalidated through the clear spoken text. However this in not the @DATE1, women are not looked down upon anymore, science is not dillouted, and ideas are free throughout the world with the internet. So is it the libraries fault for providing uncensored content or is the parents fault, for not educating their children on the morality of such items?     The modern library has very specific demographics for all items to which it posses. Movies over @CAPS2 attract both parents and teenagers alike, the music entices the teenagers, and the books and prior two media sources attract younger children. So how would it be fair to force a library to censor two of the things that earn the library the most money just so that kids don't read,watch or hear them. Plus libraries generally don't let young kids check out @CAPS3 rated movies or parental advisory @CAPS4.     Some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults. As books can raise ideas and strengthen them in a teens mind over the course of @NUM1 pages till parents end up with an anti-sematic teen with bad view on racism. So then why would that be the fault of the library as it merely provided one book that should not have affected that teen so much, had that teen had solid moral beliefs instilled in him or her from their parents.     So if you find materials at a library offensive, or worry about your child going there, there's always an easy solution. Don't go their and don't let your child go their. However if you see the beauty in impurity that a library brings to a community and to a person as I do then don't allow the injustice to authors, songwriters, musicians, directors, and yourself occur.",4,4,,4,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID1,ORG2,STY1"
3247,2,"Do you believe that certain materials in the library should be removed off the shelf if found offensive?     I believe certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some of my reasoning is very logical and if you were a reader I'm sure you want to read something thats true and very interesting. Libraries all consist of books from everything you can think of. Libraries are really for learning and not to offense anybody in any manner.     The reason why I believe they should not be removed because everybody is equal and not everybody likes to read the same books. There should be offensive books because I think that theres just to many kids that would not like to grab a book and it be orginal and not offensive about them in some way. Books are created to read and have interest, laughter, enjoying. From some of the students at my school I spoke with said that when they are really having a bad day they turn on their music and it helps them because it makes them feel alot better and the day gets easier for them. They say they dont have to be depressed or thinking about something that made them mad that day.     Well as in from my experience with books I can tell you somethings and sometimes that when I was feeling down how I grabed a book. The first time I realized books are really helpful and I'm also talkling about magazines, music and movies. Well to be honest I'm not a big reader. I enjoy listening to music because sometimes songs can relate to you and make you fell  that your not alone. Also it helps you learn how to cope with some things that you could of never coped with before because it makes you feel relaxed. Just how some of my friends said that they feel relaxed when they read a book.     So my point is that you know and I know that their are music out there that is very offensive and some books that are.  Does it drive us crazy that they do? No it does not because it actually helps us. It helps us by showing us away out from our daily streesful lifes and sometimes you learn in books and songs of how other people deal with their stress. So you learn alot of things than feel offensive about books or music. As you can tell I'm a huge music fan and there has been lots of songs that were offensive but it did not bug me much.         I hope I gave you some kind of shock that music and books should'nt be removed if offensive. It's just music is amazing as well for books we all need our space sometimes and those two things are just there for us which is either to help us learn or feel relaxed and calm. Thank you for reading this and I hope I persuaded you enough with my reasoning. Remember music and books are alot alot of fun and if you never gave it a chance, you should try it sometime.

430,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers and other technology are the best thing that ever happened to the world! I hear that computers effect people, well I don’t agree with that statement. Here are my @NUM1 reasons why. Computers and other technology make the way easier. Talking to family and friends without spending money. If you control the amount of time you use on a computer then you will be fine. Please keep reading to hear my great ideas. To start off, computers and other technology make life easier. Think about it we have access to our bank accounts, stores, reasearch, school, etc. See instead of having to go at shoppingfor food you could just order it online with no trouble. We can now shop @CAPS4 cloths and other household items. It'so easy just to look at a list and pick what you want instead of waiting in a long line. @CAPS4 example, I went to @CAPS1 to pick up a few items @CAPS4 a party. There a long line, so I just got online picked what i wanted and had it shipped to me unless then @NUM2 hours! Its cool to not have to even got up to get what you want. I know you sometimes have your since you don't wanna get up? But you have to go shopping. Doesn't computers make life so easy. Secondly, talk to family and friends without having to spend money. This is awesome because you can text, video chat, email @CAPS4 free. Computers have so many websites to talk to your family and friends like, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, myspace, yahoo, and even ohvoo. Mostly, all those you can video chat and voice chat @CAPS4 free. All of those sites you can text @CAPS4 free and touch those with your @CAPS4 example, one day I didn't want spend my to talk to my friend. So I just video chatted with them. And it was @NUM3 times better and free and better. Even @CAPS4 people long distanceis way to much money in call them. So why not just video chat I know you wouldn't wanna spend hundreds of dollars @CAPS4 a phone call bill! Please keep reading. Thirdly, if you count he amount of time you use on he computer of other technology devices then you will be fine. If you limit and set a time on the use of your computer everything will be wonderful. You can tell your body to get off the pc and get a work out or talk to friends. There's no way you could be addicted to something if you have a limited @CAPS4 it. If your the type of person that is a at something. Then @MONTH1 be you shouldn't get a computer. Like my mom gives me a limited @CAPS4 the computer @NUM4 my laptop has to be off on a school night. An @NUM3:00pm my laptop has to be off on the weekends. There's alway ways to not to be addicted. You just have to know when enough is enough. Its not the computers fault. Just have to control yourself. To wrap this up I would just like to say thank you @CAPS4 having the time to read my letter. My reasons are, computers make life easier, talk to family and friends @CAPS4 free, and if you control the amount of time you use on a computer than you will be fine.

Children loved to go to the library to check out books and many more things that they  enjoy, but a five year old does not need to see a movie, a book, or anything else for that matter descrimanting against the other gender or another race.

All of a sudden the world and its people have become dependent on information that computers provide. The variety of data bases and resources the increased communication and the skills computers allow you to portray and prove that they are essential for this generation. Communication over computers benefit now society can interact between one another. Personally I have been able to talk and see my family who live overseas through the advanced technology on computers. Different communication programs include @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and e-mail, the most commonly used cite.

It is truely astonishing how much one electronic instrument can impact and influence a life.

The internet allows any person in possesion of a computer to research what they have wondered about and to give a response on the subject almost immediately the benefits of computers can practically cover the few negative effects as it is a way to let a person discover various information on any desired subject. Besides searching for information, computers can be used to document data of your own. Microsoft has invented several applications of which allow you to graph information design presentations, and neatly record drafts of writing. No person is flawless and is incapable of mistakes. Microsoft helps take your exentuated imperfections and hide them by doing things as little as making a neater copy of your essay, or putting your lists of data into graph form to make it more eye-friendly to viewers. Society has become reliant to sources scattered throughout the date bases on computers and by directly looking at the negative effects that a computer can have on aperson and therefore putting restrictions on this information source will enable society to have to positive donations that computers these days have on our way of life.",5,5,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID1,ORG1,STY1"

Well, with the computer and internet access, you can easily contact them through great social networks such as @CAPS1.

Be wise of the kind of movies and books you leave around the library. You should have a section for children in libraries. You should have all the materials that a child should be interested in.

4702,2,"I do not think that a random stranger should have the right to decide what books to allow in a public library. If they have a problem with certain material in certiain books they should bring it to the attention of the library. The auther who wrote that book has the freedom of speech, and they are allowed to write anything that they would like to write. If somebody did not want their children looking at a book, or reading that book, then they should just tell their child to stay away from it, and if they raised their child properly, he or she should respect those boundries that the parents have set.     However, I think there should be a line drawn about what is too graphic to be displayed at a public library. Some magazines that contain graphic material are very educational, such as @ORGANIZATION1. On the other hand, I am not saying that we should be lining shelves with @CAPS1 magazines either. There is a difference between having books that educate children about other cultures, and those that educate them about sex and explicit material. It is the adults job to protect their children from material such as that. But they can do it in another way, other than taking the book off the shelf.     Even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity, the concerned parent cannot just take actions into their own hands. The owner of the library is the adult that gets to decide what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library, not the customers. I think that if you are offended by a certain book at a library, you should bring it to the attention of the owner, or simply go to a different library. If the owner refuses to remove the item from the shelf and the material offends you that much, you could go to court and plead your case to the judge.

Yet another obstacle was the power of nature; it would have been nearly impossible to keep the dirigible in place. Because of the wind ""the back of the ship would swivel around... the mooring mast"" (¶ @NUM2). The new idea was a good one but the law also was against it, because of how low the blimp would be.

3169,2,"'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is such a strong statement by Katherine Paterson in regards to censorship in libraries. So often today do we hear of books, magazines, and numerous other resources in libraries being banned because of unpopular views. A classic novel, The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4, has been removed from the shelves of many public and school libraries because of crude language such as the word 'nigger'. Libraries should not take resources off their shelves due to offensiveness because it goes against the library's purpose and because many people have different views.     A library is a place with resources provided for information, interest, and enlightnement. When a book or magazine is taken away because of origin, background, or views that seem obscene or unpopular, then that library isn't serving its purpose. If I wanted to find a book on @CAPS5 but the library banned it because another religion found its teachings offensive, then why not ban the other religion's books as well? @CAPS1 goes back to what was said by Katherine Paterson earlier. What might be offensive to one person could be a lifestyle or interest to another.      Children, however, should be treated as a special case. No, a child should probably not, in my opinion, be reading about adult things such as sex. However, that child's parent or guardian is the only one who has the right to restrict resources they feel as inapropriate. In most public libraries, young children are not aloud to roam the library without an adult. @CAPS1 is a very prominant rule because it sets boudaries for the adolescent so they are not to read about or listen to anything they shouldn't. Also, it is keen that libraries divide up the different resources into separate sections for children, young adults, and adults.      Banning books and such from libraries takes away a part of history and leaves a gap for the future. To find that what our parents were once reading is restricted should not be an issue. Materials should not be censored in libraries beacuse they are found offensive becuase @CAPS1 is censorship and it takes away our rights.",3,3,,3,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID1,ORG1,STY3"

The computer can also teach you hand-eye. Hand-eye is great to have if your trying out for a sport like football, baseball, and basketball. Also you never know when you'll need to catch somthing. My final reason is also very helpful. Being able to talk on the computer is good to using voice chat or instint messenger is your choice. While talking on the computer you might make some new friends that share the same intrests and hobbies you do. And you can chat with them as long as there online. Also while your talking you can express your ideas and feelings. Somtimes you might just need to blow off some steam. Or maybe post an idea that can one day be famous.

4401,2,"Censorship, or the ability to control what is seen or heard, is a term that is taken very differently from one person to the next. Music, if it is found offensive or inappropriate, can be consored or even banned from listening. Some magazines that are found at grocery stores, libraries, and sometimes even airports, have @ORGANIZATION1 covers on the front to visually censor the front page of the magazine. Movies are given ratings based on their level of explicit material, and when shown on basic cable, they sometimes can have either silenced words, or more appropriate words brought in to fit the dialougue in the movie. Books, although very rarely, have been banned from libraries and censored from the entire world. Some books have been previously censored, but became uncensored and brought back to libraries. In my opinion, censorship should not be based on a single person's view of the material, but rather on the viewpoint of the public. Growing up, my parents would watch carefully about what shows I watched, what music I listened to, or the types of magazines that i looked at.     When I was growing up, I loved to watch professional wrestling. I loved to watch big scary guys as tall as seven feet hitting each other with steel chairs, crashing each other into tables, or throwing each other off of twenty-foot steel cages. My brother and I used to have a favorite wrestler that we would for every week, @PERSON1 @CAPS1 could freighten any other wrestler who stood in his way. My brother and I loved to watch @PERSON1 @CAPS1 compete every week for a chance at a world chamionship belt. As time passed, professional wrestling began to welcome in beautiful women into their business. These women would come out onto the ring with tight, shiny, lingerie on as they became eye-candy for the men who watched professional wrestling. One day, I'm watching two girls fighting in a match when my mom walks in. She takes one look at the half-naked girls fighting each other and turns off the @CAPS3 and declares that professional wrestling is too adult for me. Even though I was twelve at the time, I didn't want to get in an argument with my mom about how much I should be allowed to see. Censorship can be based on the ideas and viewpoints of the parents and guardians.     I was in grade school when I fell in love with the show, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6.' @CAPS7 is a show about four boys who go on unintentional adventures to save their @CAPS4 @CAPS5. These four boys, who are all around eleven years old, use curse words that some adults would be afraid to use in every day life. Their behavior is very controversial and the show itself has been forced to ban a few of their episodes for safety reasons. One problem with @CAPS7 show was that my dad loved @CAPS7 show as well, and tried to get my mom to like the show. When my mom saw the show, she immediately banned me from watching it because of its explicit content. Now that I am older, I am able to make my own decisions about what I watch, but as a kid, my parents decided what was appropriate for me.     I grew up listening to several different types of music. My brother listened to rap, alternative, and even songs that were in musicals because he was in show choir. My dad introduced me to classic rock, and my mom loved soft rock. Although I didn't necessarily like the music that my mom liked, I learned to love my dad's music and my brother's music. I loved to listen to music from artists like @ORGANIZATION4, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and so on. My musical tastes branched out into a variety of different genres. One day, I'm walking in the hallway when I hear some music coming from the living room. I go to see what is playing because it sounds unfamiliar. My dad and my brother told me to go into another room and not listen to the music. The song was by a band named @ORGANIZATION2. Even though it might seem unfair, censorship, given by the parents and guardians, is very necessary.     Although some people might find a certain piece of material offensive, it doesn't mean that the entire world should be banned from the material itself. If that person wants to keep away from the material and keep their kids from seeing or listening to that material, they are able to do that. Censorship, given by the parents or guardians, is the best way to view censorship. Nothing should be banned from a library, music store, or any other place that sells these materials. Censorship is important, but the entire banning of a certain piece of material is unjust.",5,5,,5,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID2,ORG1,STY1"

The material they choose to read is their own choice.           How would you feel if one of your favorite books or magazine were taken off the shelves of all the libraries? You would probably wonder why such a thing would happen. Well, some people would like to argue about how some of the information that is contained in such materials are offensive or innapropriate. They want these types of things to be taken off the shelves. But is it their decision to say that some things offend people?                       Everyone has their own opinion and can make their own choice on what they want to read or what they do not want to read. In my opinion, these types of materials should stay on the shelves. It is simple, if you do not like a certain genre of magazines or books, do not read them. If you hear someones music, and it sounds completely awful to you, then just walk away or listen to your own music. Theres a new movie out about how the world is going to end, and you disbelieve in the fact that the world will not end that way, do not go and see it.      Some parents do not want their children to know about some of the things that are out there in the world, which is completely understandable. But, everyone has rights to what they want to know and what they do not want to know. If everyone had a right to take away some books that they think are not appropriate, do you think there would be any books left?

All you have to do is make a word document, and type with the keys. Let me just say this is a lot better than having to write with a pencil. Not to mention, typing a paper is a lot neater. Also, if you are doing a report on something, all you have to do is look it up on the internet, and you'll get endless information about it, all on your computer! Last but not least, you can play games on your computer. Whenever someone is bored doing nothing they can just turn on a computer, and play their favorite game.

I don'@CAPS3 believe it should work that way.  @CAPS2 are a variety of different relgions, races, and beliefs in this world, so if we took something off the shelf everytime found it offensive we would have nothing left to sell.     When it comes to younger children they are not going to know what to think and believe. When seeing and hearing things, children start to believe it.  The media that adults find offensive should not be published and out in the open for children to see and listen to. Even though the kids @MONTH1 not take offense to any of the media, you still have to think about the parents and what they believe is right for their children.

Drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big effect on children and their lives today.

My parents believe that if @CAPS2 is a law for something it is @CAPS2 for a reason and we are going to obide them.  As with some parents they have their own rules.  Such as some parents think it's okay for their children to drink under age as long as they stay home with them and they know what is going on.        A few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated @CAPS6.  I didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it and just turned they movie on and we watched it.  It had a few words in it that his parents didn'@CAPS3 agree to him watching, and he really liked the movie.  His favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his age.  He didn'@CAPS3 know any better and since he thought it was so great, he was walking up to people saying that quote.  His mother was not happy and asked where he had heard it from and he told her the movie, and she didn'@CAPS3 think that he needed to be saying that and he got in trouble.  I told her it was my fault, I let him watch the movie and didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it because my parents let me watch it when I was his age.

Over the years many things have been censored, some had an actual reason, others maybe were looked at and censored because somebody did not like how they read the book. the point is, is that people should have a choice of what they can get from their public or school library. Maybe, they should just give an idea saying that there is potentailly inapprapriate materail in that certain book and should not be read to or by a certain age group. when you look back to your childhood and think of all the books that were read to you that you enjoyed, how many of those books have been cesored for reasons that make no sense? That is the primary reason why I believe there should not be any censorship",4,4,,4,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID2,ORG1,STY2"

He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only enough water for that ride, and wasn’t prepared for the reality of his ride. First of all he is riding in the middle of the day (the hottest part) in the “high deserts of colifornia in June” I know when I go to camp here in @LOCATION1 during the summer I drink I drink six to seven liters, but the author only mentions a ""few bottles of water"" which aren't going to help him in that heat. Secondly, the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe path to follow but instead he came across a “ridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamond back” That is a poisonous snake and the cyclist has barely able to “ease post” it because, of his lack of water. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain when in fact it was “replaced by short, rolling hills” which means you have to put more effort (using more water) to climb the hills.

The builders realized that the foundation was not nearly strong enough to accommodate dirigibles, so over an additional sixty thousand dollars was spent to make it stronger. Builders then had to brainstorm how passengers would board, along with a place for baggage and ticketing. To resolve this, a glassed-in observation area and open observation platform were constructed. Another obstacle was the existing airship law for how low they could fly. The dirigibles clearly went against this law and the idea for using the mast for docking.

20860,8,"                     Laughter is a key to any happy and successful relationship in my opinion. It can break the ice in an akward situation or help you become closer to someone. Some people have said that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and that laughter is the best medicine. I believe that both of those statements are true. Personally laughter has dramatically changed many different social situations throught my @NUM1 years of life.  One time in particular that I remember laughter really bringing me closer together with other people is when I was camping with a few of my friends. It was three years ago in the middle of @DATE1 and we were all sleeping outside under the stars. We had all been talking about pretty serious stuff, family and friend problems and just sharing our hardships in general with eachother. I didn't really have much to complain about, I had a pretty average family that I loved along with good friends. However that evening I was learning some interesting but disturbing information about my friends home life. She started to talk about how her parents don't care and how they are both alcoholics, I could tell by her tone of voice how painful admitting this information was for her. The mood had suddenly changed from discussing light issues to a serious, emotional conversation. She continued to tell me how alone she felt sometimes and how she just always wished she could be with her friends because we always have a good time.   After she told me all of this we laid in silence for a while. Neither of us were asleep but I had no idea what to say. I mean how could anything I say make that situation better or help her to feel better. While we had been having this conversation our other friend had run back to the car to grab sodas and go to the bathroom. We heard her saying our names and searching for us in the dark. All of a sudden she knew where we were, she had tripped over the edge of our sleeping bag fell on us and spilled a bunch of fizzy grape soda all over our faces. Normally we would have been angry but we all thought this was hysterical. While in the midst of laughing like crazy people I looked at my friend who had just recently told me her painful story, now she was crying from laughing so hard and I knew that a little laughter had brought us closer.  That is a memory that I will never forget, it was an experience where I feel laughter has played a major role in making a relationship more comfortable and close. Similar experiences have occured throughout my whole life. Laughter is a common ground, where all people can relate to one another. Maybe it brings people closer together because when you are legitimatley laughing you are so caught up in it that you forget about everything else.

3243,2,"Have you ever walked into the library hoping to find a good book, and picked up a very volgar and inapropriate article? Were you dissapointed to see what children could easily get a hold of, or did you just place it back onto the shelf just simple thinking it wasn't your style of book? In this essay I would like to discuss both views on these censored books, and why I believe they should be censored.      People all over the world are vastly different. From color, race, size, shape, and personality there is not a single person on the planet who is excatly like the other, so why would they all have the same interest in reading or music? Some @MONTH1 enjoy a romantic novel that makes your heart skip beats while @CAPS1 my prefer the thrill of a horror story. Either way everyone has their own opinion of what makes a great book. The same thing accures in the question, whether or not censored items should be allowed into a public library.      Many @MONTH1 say yes, people have their right to choose what they @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not observe or listen to, 'If you don't like the style in which the item is protrayed then don't pick it up.' @CAPS1 @MONTH1 say no, 'The library is suppose to be a safe haven where they don't have to worry about children seeing and hearing things they shouldn't.' In my personal opinion I believe the parent figure is right, although I also can understand the opposing opinion.      As to the opposing opinion, I can understand why you @MONTH1 think that censored items are ok in libraries. If it is a personal choice of how the author writes the book and still makes a great story, I believe that the book is alright as long as it is not in reach of a child. Many people have different ideas on what censored means and there could be the consequence of loosing many books but there are always consequence to every choice, good or bad.      In my personal experince, I have taken my ten year old sister to the library to barrow a movie and a few books. She is very scholary and comprehinds things quickly. Futhermore when she found a book that she thought @MONTH1 be interesting. The book turned out to be full of curse words and profanity. Think about it, what would you say to your child who just learned a few curse words from a place you expected to be a safe enviroment? To me it is rediculous to have to search every single book, cd, movie or magazine for profanity to make sure it is safe for my sister to read! Kids these days have changed majorly in their attitudes, language, and responses to things and I believe a big part of why is because of what they take in through the worldly materials. If the books and the music they read and listen to are offensive and rude then what else would they know other than to follow the lines of something more 'cool' than them. Therefore I believe that there should not be censored books in a library, and parents should have the right to ask for them to be removed.      When I sit back and realize what I would want my kids to be reading and listening to I wonder why people would even chance the fact that their child could be negativly influenced by it. Why tempt them to be someone that reflects profanity and offensiveness when they could be so much more? Parents should do everything they can to make their kids the best person they can be and I believe that they have a right to protect their children from not reaching their full potential.

1059,1,"I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye codination, also give people the ability to and lastly they allow people to talk online. First, they teach hand eye codination and I think thats good because when people get a job they can probably more focused and can probably work faster. So if people can do that when they get a job and their jobs involve working on a computer it can be easier for them and their job can be more enjoyable. Second they give people the ability to learn more because we have all these sites that involve information an everything so people can be more knowledge so if they're more knowledged they can probably get a really good job that pays alot. And they can look up whatever they like. So if they reasearch alot and go to school they can get the job they always wanted because they know so much knowledged people are better people. Lastly they can talk to online people when people can contact each other its better because if they have no phone to reach someone they need to reach they got a computer that they can either email or use a webcam were they can see the person. I think that having a computer is good for all these reasons having hand eye cordination give people the ability to learn more and allow people to talk online with other people.",4,4,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID1,ORG1,STY3"

Paragraph two states ""I was born into this simple house...my young parents created our traditional Cuban home...the innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Narciso's parents tired to influence as much as their Cuban heritage as they could. Narciso parents were always kind and loving to others. Paragraph four states ""My parents always kept their arms open and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""

494,1,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 generation has grown up with the complex technology called computers. I have learned over the years of using them, that they aren't as helpful as the seem. They can cause an addiction, and create numerous distractions. First of all. many doctors say that computers cause ""the new depression."" The internet is where most of this takes place though. For most teenagers, having a facebook, myspace, or formspring is not unusual. I know from personal experiences, that some people abuse these social networks and use them as another way to bully people. So therefore, not only do you get made fun of in school, but now, people can make fun of you in cyberspace.. This is the main reason that people become socially depressed. There is almost no way to escape it and all of their anxiouty really starts to get to them. Addiction to computers is also a very negative impact. Many people go on the internet and are so fascinated that, that is how they spend their free time. About @PERCENT1 of people say that they are addicted. From @CAPS1 experience with using the internet. I know that there is always something that pulls you back in. You know that you are on addict when you spend more than an hour a day on the computer. Parents always say that it is a self-control issue but many adults have the same problem. They have just started to be able to use the computers, so many times they go through a phase or addiction. Furthermore, this addiction problem would be totaly gotten rid of it we stopped using computers. Finally, computers also create many distractions to students. When students sit down to type their papers they also, many times, have another at the same time. Therefore they are getting barely any work done. Social networks only just make this even worse. Constantly chatting with someone can cause tou to loose track of time. Also, when you try to multitask with the internet. Therefore causing grades to go down or not complete home work on time. All and all, this is an issue that can be easily avoided by eliminating computers. In conclusion, computers do not help us. They cause social depression, which cause people to have anxiouty problems. They cause addiction, which end up taking over peoples lives. They create divertion that make concentrating hard. I feel that computers have negative affects and they should be gotten rid of completely!",4,5,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID1,ORG1,STY3"

20921,8," Being with family and friends during a memorable trip always seems to spark a smile. There are always times to look back on; whether they are fond memories, or thoughts of nostalgia. I was about to graduate, and my parents had just broke the news to me that we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 after the year was finished. We had the date set; @DATE1, right after school was over. The first reaction out of my mouth was filled with entreatment, wishing for my best friend to join us on this trip. My parents took the time and thoughtfully considered all the advantages and disadvantages, and rapidly responded in the affirmative. I was thrilled to know that the memories I was about to create with my closest family members were now to include my best friend.  First thing was first, I had to get down to business. I needed to call my friend, @PERSON1, and ask her if she'd like to come along. Selfishly assuming that her immediate response would be an exuberant ""@CAPS1!,"" I was @CAPS4 first devastated when she postponed her response and didn'@CAPS6 seem too excited. I didn'@CAPS6 consider the fact that there @MONTH1 have been some sort of miscommunication. She talked it over with her mother, and gave me a call back. I had made the mistake of not telling her that we would have her financially covered for airfare, dining, and hotel rooms. We cleared everything up, and they decided she @CAPS3 join us. The two of us together couldn'@CAPS6 have been more ecstatic if we tried! @PERSON1 and I made a countdown board that started around two months from our departure date. There were many factors that we would take into hand while planning. As we measured out exactly how much time we had, we also planned which landmarks, resorts, and shops we would visit. Our family friend lived in @LOCATION1 @CAPS4 the time, so she gave us a tour of the island. Having such a close acquaintance to guide us made the trip even more fun. She knew all the local hangout spots, and had access to the military beaches because she works in @ORGANIZATION1!  Many humorous occurrences happened often while we were on that vacation, but some of the most memorable moments happened in the hotel while I was with @PERSON1 and my mother. My mom has always had a way to make every situation hilarious, so it was a blast when we went out on a girls night. First, and most significant of our adventures, we went shopping in the mall that was attached to our hotel. There was an abundance of varied small clothing stores, food shops, and jewelry outlets. One of our favorite stores that we visited was a @CAPS6-shirt shop with chocolate infused fabrics! We spent so much time looking @CAPS4 all of the designs, that I think we ended up carrying a wave of cocoa with us for the rest of the night.  As soon as we finished our shopping quest in the town center, we worked our way back up to the room, laughing and involved in pointless girl talk. The three of us girls shuffled with smiles, sore feet, and new bags onto the elegant, ornately designed golden elevator. My mother pushed the button to take us to our floor, while @PERSON1 carried on a story about plans we had the night before. Absorbed in conversation, we hauled our new things down the long hallway to our room. Realizing that we didn'@CAPS6 have a key card to open our room's door, the three of us decided that we should just knock on the door and my father would answer. ""@CAPS2 was supposed to be back from renting our surf boards by now, so why isn'@CAPS6 @CAPS2 answering?"" we thought, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS2 still be out on the beach?"" @CAPS4 this point our conversation died down a bit as we tried to figure out what to do. I sent a message to my dad's cell phone, and @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 was in the room. We ended up pounding on the door for a good five minutes, assuming @CAPS2 was playing a joke on us by not answering. After waiting a few moments in confused silence, I began to notice a low buzzing voice coming from inside the room. I turned to my mother and best friend, and @CAPS3 barely keep from laughing. It was then that it hit me, and I said to both of them, ""@CAPS5 guys! We didn'@CAPS6 leave a @CAPS6.V. on!"" We immediately halted our intrusion, moved as quickly as we @CAPS3 away from the door, and continued to howl with laughter. My mother had hit the wrong floor button on the elevator! We were so absorbed in having a good time that we didn'@CAPS6 even realize we were bothering someone, and embarassing ourselves!

This meant that changes would need to be made in the framework in order to support the weight. In addition, safety, weather, and legal issues were at hand. Filled with flamable gas, there was always a risk of a dirigible catching fire, and in an urban area the damage would be extremely bad. Winds at the top of the building were also dangerous. Air currents were ""violent"" and ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around"" (paragraph @NUM2). Normally, the ships would be weighted down, but, again, this was not possible in a city. The last issue builders faced was the law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). Although there was a law clearly against it, two dirigibles attempted to dock.

3647,2,"There are many books, music, movies, and magazines that people find offensive. Some people even believe these things should be taken off the shelves. I do not believe that the books, music, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelves completely. Not everyone finds these things offensive and they should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them.     First, people have different views on what they find offensive. Not everyone will find the same things offensive or want the same books or song to be removed. With people always having different views it is difficult to take books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves for everyone. Just because one person does not agree with what is being said in the movie or book does not mean that every single person wants that movie or book to be removed. If one person found my favorite book offensive I would not want it taken off the shelves completely.      Equally important, if every book, song, movie, and magazine that someone finds offensive is taken off the shelve there would not be many books, movies, songs, or magazines left. Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove a book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if every single book that offends someone is taken off the shelves there would be no books for anyone to read. People find different things offensive and if everyone took these things off the shelves there would be none left for anyone.

Instead of taking it off the shelves the person could just not read it. Not everyone finds the same books offensive and taking them off the shelves could upset many people. When someone finds something offensive they could just avoid that instead of getting it removed and upsetting other people. If someone was offened by one of my favorite books, I would prefere if they just avoid reading it instead if taking it off the shelves so that I can not read it.      Some people find many books, songs, movies, and magazines offensive. They would like these things to be removed from the shelves permenatly.

1049,1,"Dear edditer of my local newspaper In my opinion computers have a positive effect on people. I support the advances in technology. I believe @CAPS1 is a positive thing because @CAPS1 teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and even allows us to talk online with others. In the following poragraphs I will share with you my opinions and why they are the right opinions for all to believe in. Firstly hand-eye coordination plays a big part in our lives, many of us do sports. Now sports isn't just about being the best @CAPS1's about getting better and doing your best. Sports take alot of practice, and are way is computer games though I bet you didn't know @CAPS1, these games help you develope hand-eye coordination. Defeating these monsters and such really helps you in sports. Catching and throwing is a big part in alot of sports and thats all hand-eye coordination, and where do you think you get @CAPS1 from practice and computer games. So next time your on the computer play som games and that will be like practicing for sports and will help you devolop the hand-eye coordination you need to suceed in a sport. Secondly, @CAPS2 in favor for computer use is because @CAPS1 gives us the oppurtunity to learn about places and people from all around the world. Think about @CAPS1 before computers if you want to know something you might have to locate all around for a book that tells you @CAPS1, @CAPS1 could take, now you type what you want to know or google and bing theres your answer. This ability to quickly find what your looking for allows you more freedom to learn and spend other precious time doing other things you want to do then take the to locate and read the right book. As you can see this is a ability and can be a big help when you need to know something fast. So help you yourself and use computers make life easyer. Thirdly computers are a way to communicate they can let you talk to people all around the, when you might and usaly be able do. This is a great way to stay in contact wen people move, go away on a buisness trip go on vacation, or even to meet new people. Say you cany get a hold of someone because there phone is off and its important you talk to them you could email them or if there online and ahave @CAPS3.M. you could @CAPS2(instant message) them. This would save you the hessle of having to keep calling him. Also if you want to see what there doing or where they are you could us a webcome and see them instead of just talking to them. As this paragraph shows internet and computers open more then ever before. As the I wrote above, I showed not even a fraction of what computers are good for. My reasons for computers being more of positive thing, ever a negitive thing are as followed; they help us with learning things that before we couldn't, communicate with others, and help us develope hand eye coordination. I can only hope that as I write my conclusion, ""that my opinions were heard and that this letter has helped all see why computers are a great thing, not a bad one.",5,5,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID1,ORG1,STY3"

4067,2,"If we remove all books we think should't be on the shelves. What would there be to read? So many books have great detail in them to give us a vivid picture about what we're reading. Even at times the books we think are alright to read end up having a surprise that no one saw coming. I don't think we should have to remove books, music, movies etc., just because they are found offensive to some people. Instead of removing the books others love to read, what we should do is rate the books like we do movies and music. Or put the books some people find offensive in there own area.      If all books were rated like movies, we would know just what were buying or checking out. Movies are rated by the language and content they have in it. Books should be the same way. Or if someone was to find a book or magazine offensive they should be put in a different location with a labe identifing that they could be offenisve to others. I do not think they should just be removed and out of the way.      I think having books that are too offensive should be put in there own bookshelves. By doing this, people would know not to let there childeren go near them because they have been labled. And like rated '@CAPS1' movies a minor needs to be with an adut. But with books you should be find with your own choice at the age of @NUM1.      In my opinion this would be a great idea to be done and should be done. There's a bunch of books i can think of that would not be suitable for young childeren. Yet little kids love to read and could easily take a book off the shelf if they so pleased.          Many parents complain about what thier childeren read, watch, or listen to everyday. Labing would be such a great way to control a bit of what they hear and see each day. I think many parents would agree with my opinion and stand by it.

So he starts to drink an dlater died of alchol posing. Now, you dont want this to ever happen to someone who is very close to you. If people are to scared to talk about the bad things in life. Like sex, drugs, etc..Then they should make books and movies to show how bad these thing are. There should not be censorship in libraries. Some of you @MONTH1 say 'well there to young they cant hanndle these things yet.' @CAPS1 your opinon you should think of there maturity level, aslo they can learn from other peoples mistakes, and it would educate people.     How do you tell on someones maturity level? There are many ways to tell. If you talk to someone about sex and they start to laugh and make jokes then there not very mature. But, you cant asociate that every @NUM2 year old is immature. Many people @MONTH1 take this as a serious thing. Others @MONTH1 not but, they still will be able to see them in there own way. Putting censorship in libraries would not be a good idea.     Many topics in books, movies, music, magazines, etc.. @MONTH1 have inapropte things in them. Like sex, drugs, drinking, bad language. Should all these things be taken out on libraires and off the shevles? @CAPS1 a hard question to answer. But, what you can answer from that is it would allow people to learn from there mistakes. If theres a movie and a guy and he is doing drugs and later dies. People could assume that drugs kill you. But, what about the other thing? Its hard to show how its bad to say an offensive word to someone, that they herd on the radio. But, when they here that word or read about something or watch. They can ask about it and we can say that saing those things or doing them can be offensive.      Now, can you educate someone from letting the person listean, read , or watch about something offensive or etc..? It depends on the person. But, you can educate someone about the subject matter. No matter how offensive the topic is. We should teach people about them. If we dont, its bound to repeat it self. Say if we censor the holocaust becuase of how horifying it was. No one would no about it and we would most likely repeat the holocaust. Censoring certain things a library would not be that good of an idea.      Ceratin people can hanndle talking about certain subjects. Its not always a good thing to censor offensive subjects. We need to teach people about these thing to educate them, and also so they can learn on what has been done and not repeat it, also some people can handle these materials, they just need to have a high maturitly level.

4160,2,"Have you ever been to a library and found a book offensive?In my opinion I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are at the library for a reason. The reason being say if we wanted to check out a movie and everywhere else was to expensive to get it, why wouldn't you just get it at the library if they had it. Most libraries that I've gone to have certain sections for adults and children. That means there would be appropiate things for little children to read in the section that they have been given. If children under age were to wander off into the adult section that would be their fault if they saw something unapproiate not the libraries.     If the case was if every time a child or someone under age took a book offensive, I belive that the libraries wouldn't have as much of books in their buildinds that grown ups would like to read. Of course I'm not trying to say that there should be extermely unappropriate books wandering around in the library that the small children should see. I'm just saying that the adults do have the right to have books that they would be interested in.When I've gone to the libraries I have found books that I have enjoyed reading and I'm not the type of person that would just grab a book and be interested in right away. There are books, movies, magazines, and music that have strange titles that some people might take offensive to, but those are the ones that get read more or listend to more or watched more.     I believe that no material should be taken off of the shelf just because one person found it offensive. If the person doesn't like the idea of the people in the library not taking the material off; it's the person personal problem I think. For example there is this book called '@CAPS1' and it's about a teenager who got into drugs real bad and got pregnate at a young age. That book was one of the best selling books in the world. If somebody took that offensive and asked for the book to be removed then it's their loss.     I mean if there were a book about how to murder somebody then yeah I would ask for that material to be taken off the shelf immeditely. Except no library in this entire world would have that kind of stuff up so why worry about it.If there were ever to be that type of situation then that would be bizzare.But I highly doubt that it would come to a point like in time.

15382,6,"The builders of the empire state building faced many problems in attempting the dirigibles to dock there. Some of the most apparant reasons were because of what the dirigibles were made out of, weather conditions, and existing laws about airships flying over urban areas. Dirigibles were not made out of the safest materials, most were made with hydrogen, which is extremely flamible. This would make the docking Station unsafe if the dirigible ever caught on fire. If the dirigible were to ever get caught on fire, the accident would be very severe, since the Station would be over a densely populated area. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to the violent air currents atop the empire state building, the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, making it unsafe to dock there. If something happened to the dirigible, it would be unsafe for the many pedestrians below it. The last reason for the docking station not being built is in paragraph @NUM2 because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" It would be illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the docking station because of this law. This law is because of the high winds, fearing that they would blow the dirigible onto other buildings.
