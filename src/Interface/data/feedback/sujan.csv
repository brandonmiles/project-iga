He was cycling in California - which is a hot place to begin with - in June - which made it even hotter coming upon a hot desert. When youíre doing a physical activity like that, the last thing you want is to be in the heat. The narrator only brought one bottle of water which at first he was drinking regularly. Then it started to get hot and he was out of water. This affected his body by making him tired, and his mind because he started doubting himself. Then there was the abandon juice building where they made juice. He said ìIn an ironic twist abandon years earlier had been a Welchís grape juice factory and bottling plant.î He was dying of thirst and then he found the bottling plant. The cyclist was definatly affected by his surrondings both mental - by saying ìIím going to die.î - and physically by becoming dehydrated.",2,2,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
966,1,"Dear the daily newspaper crew, I have seen some of your own disagree about using computers. I for one believe that using a comenter really isn't that bad. For example, the computer is actually good for education. Many use them to create @NUM1 images of things for schoolprojects or science fair projects. I use these machines to play video games on to cure my boredum like most young teens and children do. Unlike most people I dont stay on it forever. I usually play for a couple hours. There are some downsides to having computer in the house. For one the machines use up load of energy in the house making the electric bill rise and @DATE1. On some websites there are people who try to be a stalker like the website my space and twitter but on the bright side these who try to be a stalker usually instantly get caught and put in jail. Computers actually have a positive effect on the mind and movements. For example children who have computers learn how to fly a kite or for themselves with their parents watching and they learn hand-eye. Many children who play sports that have computers actually manage to catch a ball faster than usual. So you see computers are not that bad. So please think of what will happen to children if computers are banned.",3,4,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the essay, you can infer that the cyclist doubts he will ever make it to Yosemite because of the constant features in the essay that cause him to lose his hope and confidence.

He hurries to the building only to find out that it is an abandoned, runñdown @ORGANIZATION1 factory. After getting his hopes up, he is forced to get back on his bike and carry on. This features of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind.

It makes us feel happy and feel loving, especially in a few sections.First, when the author talked about what his familly did at home, it made theworld slow down and think about the family. Narcisoc (the author and narrator) said in paragraph two, ""endless celebrations and that encompassed both, formed the back drop to our life in our warm home"". This made a picture of a happy and laughing family like in the movies about the holidays.Second, Narciso said how united they all were. This painted a mood of unity and care. In paragraph four @PERSON1 recalled, ""My parents always kept thier arms and thier door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us"".

No one wants to read a boring article, not unless it's meant to be. I'm going to share with you my opinions on certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, ect.,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I have observations, experience, and reading some of my the articles that were called offensive to prove my opinions.     In my opinion, no ones work should be taken off of a shelf due to any thing, because I'm sure they worked on it an awful lot for it to be placed on a shelf. So there is no reason for it to be taken off. If that was my stuff that had got took off the shelves I would be shocked and upset. So that is one reason why you shouldn't do that. It could hurt people emotionly.     Following that statement, but there can be times where you just don't want them to be seen because they are to embarrassing. Such as an athlete interviewed in an @CAPS1 article, that got suspended from their sport due to violations, and this athlete is just cursing and being out of control. I would put that article away also, just so the public won't see it and no one is put on blast.     Finally, @CAPS2 everyone knows that some types of movies, and music can't be put on display in public. So you would have to ask for the movie or @CAPS3 and someone will go get it from the back for you, due to explicit content or explicit lyrics. G-@CAPS4 @NUM1, should be the only movies allowed on shelves, rated @CAPS5 and up should be behind counter, and the same with music. I am pretty sure that is clear with this audience.     @CAPS2 that I have shared with you my opinions on different views on censorship in libbraries what is you thoughts on this topic as you read this persuasive essay.

Even if people banned some books from the libray, other people would find a way to get them. we as the people of aAmerica have the right to live freely, which also includes the right to read freely.      As for music and movies i think we have let ourselves go a little too far. We have made pornography an easily obtainable thing, and music that promotes sex, drugs, violence, and alcohol. The only thing keeping us from pure evil is the @ORGANIZATION1 and their ratings on movies, music, and television.     With magazines its a little more complicated than the others, maga zines have their own set of standards.

If you don't want little kids and teenagers in those kinds of books and magazines then put I lock on the door and if you have proof of @CAPS1 that shows your @NUM1 then you are going to be aloud back there if you don't have proof of @CAPS1 then I guess your not going back to the adult section.     I say this because they have movies at the movie stores that are not aloud to be seen unless your @NUM1, but the thing is kids have imaginations that if you read a book you can also see pictures just like a movie. The movies in the movie store are locked up in a back room where you have to be @NUM1 or older to go back there and look. I bet its ruff when your kid is reading books and getting bad words out of them and saying them around like an even younger sibling, because then thats just going to cause a bigger problem then what you started out with.     People have to understand theses days that kids are growing up way to fast to just leave stuff like that laying around. Parents need to keep stuff like magazines, movies, pictures, books and stuff like that up away from kids. I feel like once you become a parent you automatically think your smarter than a kid but yet kids are pretty darn smart. I understand its only a word but its disrespectful to have your kids running around cussing and saying inaproperiate things to nice people.       When kids do that then othere parents that don't let their kids do that stuff think ' wow these parents obviously don't care'. I have a feeling that its never going to stop but it would be better if childrens parents did not let them cuss around other people ok at home if your parents don't care then sure but when you go out to eat or something and your son or daughter is over there cussing like a freight train its all because of those books she has been reading, the magazines and the movies.

1217,1,I think having computers are good because you can use it to find places. Another reasons why its good is that you can talk to your friends from the computer. You can play all types of different games and get pictures and its is good to do your homework. That is why computers are good and we need them. First reason that we need computers is that it can be a map for us.

21130,8," I used to love hermit crabs. The cute little creatures who hid in their shells fascinated me. When I was about six my family decided to take a road trip along a @CAPS1 coastline. We were accompanied by another family with four kids. Put together there were @NUM1 kids for me to play with, but the closest one to my age was @PERSON1. He was only a couple years older than me. I adored @PERSON1. We explored, swam, giggled, and played tricks on our siblings together. Everything he did, I did.  We went to so many different beaches I can't remember half of them, but one in particular stood out. It was a short and slender beach. On one side there was a cave. The cave was loaded with hermit crabs. Never in my life have I seen so many of them. There were mini hermit crabs, great big hermit crabs, and even bigger hermit crabs! It was as if our dreams had come true. @PERSON1 and I created sand castles, prisons, and water channels to keep the hermit crabs contained. Our older siblings weren't interested in them at all. That was alright though, in our eyes it only meant more for us!  When it was time to leave, @PERSON1 and I were devastated. We both knew that we wouldn't just come across another beach like this is the future. It finally hit us that we wouldn't be able to keep our beloved crabs. We stayed down on the beach near the cave for hours just saying our ""good byes"". When my mom eventually yelled across the beach saying that it was time to go, we both had made a quick decision. I had watched girls stuff shells into there bathing suits before. I thought why not? @PERSON1 liked the idea, so we silently slid two hermit into our swim trunks. His crab in the pocket of his shorts, mine in my one piece swim suit. It sagged at the bottom, but I decided to ignore it and pretend like nothing was wrong. Guilt weighted down my scrawny little body, like I had stuck a ten pound rock in my suit, not a tiny little crab. My mom had asked me directly if I had left all the hermit crabs on the beach. I nodded, but my voice was absent.  Back on the road my sister and I played word games. Everything was fine, the music playing, my parents talking. and our wheels rolling down the narrow dirt road.Every once in a while I would have to move a little because I could feel my little hermit crab checking out his surroundings. We had been driving for about an hour when I let out a blood curdling scream. As my dad slammed on the brakes dust swirled around the car like a hurricane. I remember my mom swiveling in her seat to look at me and ask what was wrong. I didn't answer. As the pincers grabbed on again, I let out another urgent scream. I then decided it was time to quit hiding my little friend in the bottom of my swimsuit. Letting out the last prolonged scream I pointed down to my crotch. My sister's urgent hands pulled my swimsuit off and quickly found the little devil. I was so embarrassed and guilty that my mom just laughed. She said that I had already gotten my punishment for lying, and that she thought I had learned my lesson. I sure wasn't going to disagree on that. A few minutes later, our friends pulled over too. When we asked if everything was okay, they said while laughing, that one of the girls had gotten pinched by @PERSON1's hermit crab. That sent all of us laughing.  We never stopped laughing about that story. My family loves to humiliate me in front of friends, guys that I like, or adults that I don't even know. Every time my mother says that that crab grabbed right onto ""where it counts"" we all bust out laughing. And every time I turn tomato red in embarrassment, but I guess I deserve it.  @PERSON1 and I both learned our lessons, although I think I learned a few extra lessons. First of all, never put and animal near your ""sensitive"" parts. The second lesson was don't lie, because eventually you will most likely be be caught and punished. The last lesson would have to be to learn how to enjoy something when you have it and when it is time to let it go, let whatever it is let it go, and be grateful for the time you got to enjoy it. If I would have been able to just say good bye to my shelled friends, I would have never lied or felt so much pain. They were all great lessons to learn, and I am very grateful for them. Not only because I became a little wiser, but also because I have a great story to tell that always sends people up in laughter.",25,20,,45,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,
1344,1,"In the world we live in now, everything is getting technilogical. In my own opinion, its a good thing. Using computers has been very helpful to our society. They give people the opportunity to research things fast and easily, they save trees, and they're a wonderful way to communicate with people. First, computers are great to use for research instead of books that waste tree. A few years ago, kids would get a school project on a certain country and the thing that would came to mind is the library. But, nowadays it's computers. Sure, of course books are very helpful, but so is the internet, plus its much faster and easier to find to find the information you're boking for. You can learn about a place before visiting it with a click of a button and learn about places far away. It really is magical. Next, using computers saves trees. With a computer we don't have to keep cutting down so many trees for books and paper. Another can now sell their books online and people are able to read them right. Honestly, there really is no reason to keep making books. Even students can do their home work, test and quizzes online! I think it's a mirical and it's so amazing to see how much our world has changed in only about @NUM1 years. Finally, computers are great to communicate with people far away. Some people have family in the war who they don't see for months or maybe years. With a computer you can get emails that get deliveres to the person right after being sent. Or you can even webcam and actually see the person face to face! It must be hard not being able to see your loved ones everyday, which is why a computer is very helpful. Even to those who have a family member away on a business trip or that live in another state/country. Computers are very helpful, especially today with everything going on in our world. With computers we can online research, save trees, and communicate with people far away. So, in my opinion computers do benefit society.",4,4,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1031,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I beleave that computers have a good and a bad effect on people. Even though I think it has both effects on peope, I think that it has a better effect I think this because the internet gives people the chance to learn more about other places. Allows people to talk to family that lives far away, and it also helps to make new friends. I support the advances of technology. I support it because people can talk to their family that they can't get to see. I have three cousins that live in @LOCATION1 that I never get to see, but with computers I can talk to them all the time. We can email and @CAPS2 to chat to eachother to find out what they've been doing, hows school, and so much more. My aunty loves to send and get pictures from them to see how much they've changed since the last time we saw them. Without the new technology we wouldn't be able to do that. Computers also help learn about other countries and the people that live there. With the internet you can find what the country looks like, what types of food they eat, what type of language they speek, and so much more. Recently I had to do a project in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 about a place in @LOCATION2. I got @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3 with the help of computers I found out so much more about the country that I never even know about. There were so many great places to visit and learn about the history of @LOCATION4. Learning so much about the place makes me want to visit there someday. Without computers I never would have learned so much about that place. Another great thing about the new technology is that we can make new friends and talk to different types of people from all over the world. I read recently in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that atleast @PERCENT1 of kids have a myspace or facebook that helps them interact with people from all over the world. There can also be dangers to talking to people you've never met before. To be safe don't tell people your phone number or where you live. But meeting new people can also be good. For example, my cousin doesn't get along very well with the people she goes to school with. But after school she goes on her computer and talks to people that are just like her. Either way she should be careful. In conclusion, I must say once again that I support the advances of technology to an extent. Computers help you talk to family that you don't see, helps you learn about new countries, and meet new people. Thank you for your time.",5,4,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

15726,6,"Upon taking up the task of building a mast for dirigibles to dock at, the architects encountered many obstacles which made the idea of a mooring mast unplausable. One obstacle they ran into was the violent nature of the wind currents above the city. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building with a tether, then the back would be free to swing and sway. Another factor they had to consider is that dirigibles are full of the flamable gas hydrogen which imposed the risk of a serious fire hazzard about New York City. Even if the engineers and architects managed to work out all of the kinks of building the mast, they still would face another obstacle. It was illegal to fly dirigibles to low over urban areas.

1447,1,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, computers are a wonderful tool and they bear many positive impacts on society first, computers have created numerous @CAPS2 forms of communication. Also, they have enable us to create a @CAPS2 age in research. In addition, computers have given us amazing @CAPS2 ways to entertain ourselves computers have a incredibly positive effetct on people. One reason why computers have such a positive effect on humans, is that we have developed many @CAPS2 ways to communicate with people all over the world. First, one fantastic program such as @CAPS5 (instant messaging) has given us the amazing ability to hold a conversation with one or more people any where in the world, and be able to respond within an instant. In a recent survey @PERCENT1 of people said that they prefer instant messaging over any other type of communication beside face to face talking, second, most computers come with webcams built in now, so you can actually see the person you are communicating with. I had friend move recently, and we are able to see what each other are doing and remain friends even though we don't live in the same town, and I'm sure a similar experience has occured to you or someone you know. Finally, the popular program of facebook has changed communication forever. People can now see things go on in your info whereever want. Although some it has a wonderful computers have established incredible ways of communication. A second reason computers positively import people is that they have created a numerous research. One example would be our phenomenon search engine, google. Google to almost everything with help people in finding schools now use computer resources such us @CAPS6 which allow in research to the fact that there is so much availbale on the.

21109,8,"  Laughter is a important part of my life.The best way to pass the time is laughing with friends and family. Think back on all the fun times you've had, if you do you'll find that most of them you are laughing. That's because laughter and fun go hand in hand. Everyone likes to have fun, therefor everyone likes to laugh. Laughing is good for you in many ways, it keeps you happy, helps maintain healthy relationships with others, and it relieves stress.  Also a lot of people laugh when there nervous, I'm one of these people. Especially when you're put in a awkward situation. Like when you have to do a speech in front of the class. I remember my first speech in high school, it's one of the scariest things I've done. It was @CAPS1 year and I slouched down in my chair and tried to get as low as possible so the teacher couldn't see me. I wouldn't make any eye contact with her either. I put my back pack in front of me in order to block her view. Every time she'd look around the room to pick another person to go I'd hold my breath and hope it wasn't me. Every time it wasn't me I would breath out in relief.  Finally it was getting down to a few people and I knew my doom would soon await me. I decided to take a chance and peek over my back pack to see who the teacher was looking at for her next victim. What I saw when I looked at her was her eyes meet mine. I tried to hind behind my back pack again but it was to late. She had already started to call my name out.  What should I do? I thought to myself. Should I tell her I'm not ready? Should I try to get out of it? I wiped my sweaty palms on my blue jeans.Then I stood up and started to walk toward the front of the room. I could feel a nervous knot building up in my stomach. With note card in hand, I began to speak. My words were quiet and shaky. My speech was about uniforms in school and if I agreed with them or not. As I went on I could feel myself start to trip over my words. Then I started to laugh, which I always do when I'm nervous. I could hear other people in the room start to snicker. I smiled and looked down at my note card and continued my speech. After wards I felt a big relief to get it over with. It wasn't perfect but laughing at myself when I messed up helped me get through it without falling apart from my nervous.  Although not everyone reacts this way, laughing can help relieve tension in some situations.But always be careful not to laugh in situations were it's not appropriate. It's not good for you to have constant stress. Finding things to laugh about can be a good way to relieve stress. Laughing might not be the right behavior to get a A on your speech but it did help me keep it together to make it through. Laughter is important to everyone. It's a good way to have fun with others and it keeps you happy. Laughing is a good way to relieve stress. Your relationships will grow stronger if you find things in common to laugh about. If you learn to laugh you're sure to have a fun and happy life, I know I do. ",20,20,,40,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,
15711,6,"In the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, if a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether was moored at the top of the building, it would add stress to the frame. The workers had to transmit the stress ""All the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" They had to modify & strengthen the frame, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. They also had to design an ornamental mast with four wings to house the mooring arm. What the builders did not realize was that their mooring mast not only had problems the frame work, but the dirigible would swivel around without being able to use lead weights to hold it down. There was nothing they could do to prevent this, flammability, or existing laws.",2,2,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

21233,8,"                            Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4  @CAPS1 your little, your exactly that, little. You look up at everyone with not a faint clue of @CAPS6 to do anything. Now, this is usually @CAPS1 your parents step in. They feed, and love and take care of you, but @CAPS4 importantly, they teach you what you need to know. Growing up I've learned that you need to help others, not just yourself. One way I find easy for me to help others is with laughter. Laughter isn't something that just effects the people around you, @CAPS2 also effects you. You can ask anyone if once in they're life anyone has ever made a difference by making them laugh. Or could have made a difference my making them laugh. @CAPS4 will be able to think of a time this has happened, some @MONTH1 not. Though I know for a fact, someone has made a difference in my life just by making me giggle. For instance, I remember a day @CAPS1 I had felt so alone and forgotten. I felt used, betrayed even. Growing up I knew my friends as a second family. They were always there for me. Though like @CAPS4 kids we fought, but by the end of the day everything was backed to normal. People say, ""@CAPS6 come I never noticed @CAPS6 easy I had @CAPS2 @CAPS1 I was little? I thought I had @CAPS2 bad then?"" @CAPS7 @CAPS2 doesn't matter @CAPS6 the problems change its all the same. @CAPS2 still hurts to fight with friends. You still have days you feel horribly alone, but your not quite sure why. One of those days where the littlest thing seem to cut the deepest. This day was one of those kind of days. Now see, I was young then; I was only in the third grade, and my best friend had been a girl named @PERSON1. I don't remember exactly what we had fought over, but I do remember @CAPS6 if felt.   I remember walking in the classroom, near tears by then. I'd dealt with @PERSON1 being so cruel before, but whatever she had said that day had really hurt me. I was always the first in the classroom, I'm not sure exactly @CAPS6 I was, but I always was. In my seat I sat down and didn't move. My brain had taken me to my own little world of sorrow. That's @CAPS1 she asked me what was wrong. Even as a child I hated @CAPS2 @CAPS1 people I didn't really know asked me if I was okay. @CAPS2 embarrassed me, for @CAPS2 was just another reminder that I was showing weakness to people who probably didn't care. Though this time @CAPS2 was different, and in a weird way @CAPS2 helped. I explained to my teacher what had happened in a rush of tears and details. What really made a difference is that after everything, my teacher tried to comfort me and make me feel better, she made me laugh. Whatever exactly I had told her, her response didn't just make me feel better, but made me realize @CAPS2 wasn't that big of a deal. I giggled for a while to myself, and by the time everyone was in the class I was happy. At the end of the day me and @PERSON1 were back to being best friends. My teacher honestly did me a favor. As a kid your vulnerable. You don't look at the world as a harsh, unforgivable place. That's why people turn out like they do. Its all about the environment they grew up around. I believe I was changed by that small effort. That one little joke made me realize everything's going to get better in the long run. Laughter's been important to me ever since. I helped me realize the effect you have on people. Even at a small age you still can make a difference. Since then I've used what my teacher had taught me. I learned that sometimes, even if you couldn't make them laugh, smile or just be happy; the fact that you tried really made the difference.

4108,2,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1,     @CAPS1 I was growing up in my small little neighborhood, life could not have been more simple.  For children, life is eating, sleeping, playing, and laughing.  Their innocent minds do not ponder the meanings of life or of love, but curiosity does grab every child now and then.  With a stubborn persistance, a child would probably go to the ends of the earth to understand what confidential information they overheard their parents talking about.  But @CAPS1 does harmless curiosity mean the destruction of a child's innocence?  By viewing adult-oriented material, such as books at a library, children can gain premature knowledge that can be harmful to their development.  However, libraries should not fear stocking their shelves with books that are appropriate for adults because an author spend countless hours writing that book,  that book represents a portion of history for the human race, and not everyone @MONTH1 find the contents inappropriate.     Authors have the freedom to write about whatever interests them, and taking away their right to display their thoughts and opinions is unjust.  A censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite hours of practice.  Thus, an author that has practiced and perfected his writing skill does so in hopes of publishing his work.  Not agreeing with someone's interest in a subject is no reason to exclude his valuable thoughts from society.  Books that are appropriate for adults deserve to be displayed for adults as the author intended.     Every piece of literature that has ever been written documents a portion of history of the human race.  Even fictional novels serve as monuments to the depths of man's imagination.  Therefore, no book should be censored, no matter how inappropriate the material is.  Just as remembering the @CAPS2 has influenced mankind not to repeat past mistakes, keeping books of the most horrible content @MONTH1 save authors from repeating such dishonorable content.  In other words, if censorship removes the 'mistakes' of literature from library shelves, who is to say that an oblivious author will not repeat that 'mistake'.  By remembering these mistakes, mankind will be able to move forward in literature.  @CAPS1 books are not 'mistakes', they serve as reminders of the high-points in literature.  All literature, appropriate and inappropriate, is a piece of mankind's history that should not be kept a secret.     Finally, who is to judge what is a 'mistake' in literature?  A book on @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be inappropriate in the eyes of a @CAPS4, but that book @MONTH1 be sacred to a @CAPS5.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Furthermore, for any given book there is at least one person who disagrees with its message.  A library is built for the education of the public, not for the interests of one person.  If one is offended by a literary work, perhaps he should just move on and find a book more suited to his interests.  The decision on the appropriateness of a novel is up to the reader, not the government or library or activist group.     Censorship of material in libraries would strip authors of their chance to let their works be seen by others, keep records of the human race secret, and take away the privelage of the reader to decide what is appropriate.  Authors endure long hours of practice and writing in order to have their thoughts read, and such a motive should not be taken away from them.  Every book represents some aspect of human life and records it for future generations to avoid previous mistakes.  And these 'mistakes' are decided by the reader, a decision that censorship takes upon itself.  Instead of choosing what books are seen by the public, perhaps libraries should just create an adult-only section to house the 'controversial' books; as a result, mankind would stay educated and free, and children would remain innocent.                                   -@ORGANIZATION2",6,6,,6,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This also contributes to the reason that Saeng believes in herself and she truly thinks she can pass the test. Lastly I think that this last paragraph snowed how Saeng wants people to know that even some as small and meaning less as a plant can help her overcome obsticles, and lead her to her dreams.

15780,6,"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles such as weather, chemistry, and construction issues in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the height of the building meant that, ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Due to the violent wind currents, the backs of the dirigibles would constantly orbit around the mast. Another problem that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the gases that most dirigibles were made of. Most of the dirigibles from outside the country were made out of the gas hydrogen: an incredibly flammable gas. This problem was exhibited by the German dirigible Hindenburg that was destroyed by a fire. With this misfortune, the owners of the Empire State building noticed ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as a downtown New York"". With this realization, the builders of the Empire State Building finally came to realize that a dirigible dangling high above the street was not safe or a practical idea. Lastly, the construction of the building itself posed a problem the obstacles of the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would put stress upon the frame of the building and would be incredibly expensive to modify. However, the builders fixed this problem at the cost of sixty thousand dollars. Unfortunately, the other problems with the construction were too great.",4,4,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, computers have benefits such as talking to friends and family you don't see that often, doing school work, and gathering information. But in my oponion I the people should reduce their usage of computers. Sure, computers let you interact with friends in family via e-mail, or @CAPS2 messaging, or social networking websites such as @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. Guess what? You can easily communicate the old fashioned way with cell phones, or even writing a letter. See? There are alternitives for communication.

Thats a fairly big percentage, and we don't want it to get any bigger. If people are wasting away, staring at their computer screen and not getting any sort or exercise in, the number will get bigger. Also, computers can cause all kinds of medical problems. For example, about a month ago my back was really bothering me. I went to the doctors and he told me one of the likley causes was leaning foward togo on my laptop. ""Computers can also cause vision problems and haedaches."" says specialist @CAPS5. Oz. We can prevent these issues if we take a stand against computers!

1132,1,"Dear Newspaper, I disagree that computers are important to people because they have research, online colleges, and online stores. Those are my top @NUM1 reasons and I'm going to give more details. My first main idea is that computers help students find important information help students find important information on a project. You can do on the wikepedia to help find information about the battle of @LOCATION1 and other important history. one example is I went to american history.com to find good information about @CAPS1 alley @CAPS2 and what happened there. People also look up a lot of stuff that involves school. You can get research about the earth and what happens to it. My second main idea is that computers are good for people is when you finish high school, you can go to college. Some colleges can be found on the internet and you can go to college at home on your computer. One example is my cousin. She goes to college on the internet because she has to take care of her two children. Whenever you watch television you see a commercial about online colleges because they are trying to tell you to go to school online. My third and final reason why computers are good for you people is that some stores have an online store where you can look at what they have in the store. Children like to go shopping alot but they can't go to the mall or the stores because you don't want to go. You can let them see what they want and buy it online than going to the stores. It can be shipped to your door without going anywhere. My mom sometimes orders from @CAPS3.C @CAPS4 so she doesn't have to go there. It gets shipped to our house in less than a week.

They can been used to look up information, talk to family and friends music etc. Don't you think people are wasting more time on the computer instead of getting exercise. It's clear that computers can do just about anything want than to do. But why spend your time on the computer when you can spend time with your family. Playing sports, or getting some fresh air. I think computers have a positive effect on people and negative effect one of the positive effects is being able to talk to your friends. i know sometimes we are not able to see them as much in school. In my opinion I think it is a great way so you can catch up on funny times that you can and friends shared. Now here comes the negative effect. Mang kids get bulled and picked by other kids over the internet. This can cause other kids to have a low self esteem, and cause dangerous events in the future. When it comes to computer they have saved many people life. Some of these ways are finding cures to harmful deases. Computers have information when serious weather storms are coming and prepare us for the weather. Wouldn't you agree that computers have played a huge role in our lifes.

D     @CAPS1 you know that there is more than @CAPS5 radio station? Well, @CAPS3 you do. Not just @CAPS5 person should be able to talk for everyone. I enjoy every genre of music and books.  @CAPS4's pretty much my life. All I know is that when I get offended by a song, I change @CAPS4. When I'm reading a book I don't like, I put @CAPS4 down. @CAPS4's not your job to make my decisions. I live my own life and personally think you should live yours as well.     Books, movies, plays, games, magazines, all things of that sort are for our entertainment. If they began taking them off shelves because of vulgar things and things that offend people, then why do we have freedom of speech? Those people that are offended need to put whatever @CAPS4 is down and move on.  Just because a handful of people are offended by the everyday things that people use to stay amused, doesn't mean they need to be taken away.      Authors and directors spend months, even years making movies and writing books just to entertain us and feel accomplished. If they started taking them off our shelves and off the big screens, people would lose jobs. For example look at the @PERSON2 @ORGANIZATION1. That can easily offend a person, but those are brilliant pieces of work.      I am personally the kind of person that reads books that are suspenseful, books that keep me on the edge of my seat. People enjoy books that they can relate to, and some people can relate to those books that are 'offensive.' I, myself, have read a book that cinsisted of drugs and viloence that I related to and @CAPS4 helped me out, @CAPS4 made me realize its not always the right thing to do.      I think people need to realize that all those books, movies, magazines, and all the aboe that 'offend' them, are reality. No matter where you go, what you do, what you throw out, or what you keep in the house, your kids, parenst, friends, everyone will see @CAPS4 sometime in theirlives.      Viloence and drugs are seen everyday. Many more things that offend people are always going to be there. If all of those things are offensive to some people, then they need a reality check.  Books like that can influence kids to wanna go the rightdirection. They read a book or see a movie with a drug addict in prison and theyll think, '@CAPS2, I'm never going there.' @CAPS3, I can't say that goes for all kids in this world, but you get the jist of what I'm trying to say.     If @CAPS4's the parents that are worried about their kids getting into that kind of stuff, be my guest to remove @CAPS4 from your household, but not from everyone, not from the people who enjoy @CAPS4. I'm a strong believer that people know right from wrong, so why not just grow up a little bit and do what's right? Those books, movies, and magazines that are offensive, are enjoyable to me.      This makes me think of drama. People say they hate @CAPS4, but no matter what, @CAPS4's everywhere, and @CAPS4 will always be everywhere. If you can't get through life being offended every @CAPS3 and then, then how do you think you'll survuve. What do you think is in store for the next years to come?  You must learn to deal with @CAPS4.     Taking away all of these things, I think, is a mistake. If people are against @CAPS4, they need to worry about themselves and just leave @CAPS4 alone. They can make their own decisions, they don't have to pick up and @PERSON1 book when there is a @ORGANIZATION1 in their reach. That is what literature is about, writing. Do you honeslty think the author was worried about offending anyone? No, because the author or director whom wrote the book or made the movie, they knew what is was about and they know that not all of the world will see @CAPS4. Not all of the world will care to see @CAPS4. They know that people are smart enough to read the summary before they get'offended.'      @CAPS4 irritates me when people think they need to live for everyone. @CAPS4's like the saying, '@CAPS5 man's trash is another man's treasure.' You might not like @CAPS4, you might even hate @CAPS4. But once @CAPS4's out of your hands, the next person might come back and drastically fall in love with @CAPS4.     I think that just because someone picks up a book and @CAPS4 offends them, @CAPS4 doesn't mean they needed to whiped off the shelves. Grow up, put whatever @CAPS4 is that offends you down, and walk away.",5,4,,5,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think that libraries should censor the books, movies, and magazines so that either they are in a certain room where only adults can see or get them, or they are not in the library at all. The books in the libraries can have some very obseen items in them that young children should not be able to see.     I have been to the library many times, whether it be by myself or with others. I know what is out there and some of the books or movies are not always kid rated. I would like to someday beable to take my own child into the library knowing that what they are going to see is okay for their eyes.      Magazines are always talking about new relationships or this person is having a baby or anything along those lines, and I don't want my child seeing that. The library I usually go to has the magazines out where everyone can view them and I don't want this for my son or daughter who is of a young age. I think a parent should be able to take their children into a library knowing that when their child runs up to them with a book, it will be something that they are aloud to read or get and not something that an adult would read.      Libraries could always make a seperate room for books and movies that are not always for children. Such as the rated @CAPS1 movies or books that are inappropriate for young children. That way when a little kid is running around looking for a new book to read, they can't see or pick up these books or movies. I don't know about the other adults or parents out there, but I sure don't want my little kid walking around talking about an inappropriate book or movie they saw at the library.     Since libraries have many different kinds of magazines, books, and movies, it is not always a safe place to just let your child roam around. Libraries could always make a seperate room for items like this. For the books that are for older @ORGANIZATION1, movies that are rated @CAPS1, or magazines such as @ORGANIZATION1. I think that if libraries did this, parents would be much more at ease to taking their children and letting them run around and look for new and interesting books to read or movies to watch",4,4,,4,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most dirigibles from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obsticale to the successful use of the mooring was nature itself.

My opinion is that materials that @MONTH1 be offensive to certain individuals should not be taking off the shelf, but put in a certain section that says adult material such as books, music, movies,etc..     I myself have experienced not being able to get a certain movie because of my age. The book was called @CAPS2 @PERSON1, but it was just full of action/adventure.This was very unfair in my eyes, just because I was young I couldnt check out a certain movie. This was experience that I been through, which lead me to my opinion that materials that might show certain offenseto someone should not be removed.      Another reason that the materials should stay on the shelf is because many people like different things. No one is going to have the same interest all the time. So by takiny materials away is just helping one person, but hurting many by taking somethimg they @MONTH1 be interested in. I can understand that people have been through things, and might not be happy that offensive materials are around. Then again I think all materials are not the same they can get the materials they enjoy, and leave the other materials up to other people to choose from.     In conclusion I believe that the materials that show offense to certain people should stay. The reason being is because by the material that might show offense to an individual, might just be very interesting to another person.

Did you know that teenagers who use computers often when compared to those who don't, have increased test scores? This is because they are able to look so definitions faster, research and learn about anything they need at their fingertips. Furthermore, families and friends that live across the country are able to keep in touch due to email, video chats and facebook. It is fascinating to realize that use of the computer can increase your hand eye coordination. You are probably wandering how this is and think that I am insane but there are legitimate reasons. Since I play basketball, volleyball and softball, hand eye coordination is extremely important. One cold, wintery @DATE1 @TIME1.

At five o'clock off I went to my basketball grow, @CAPS2 the best game of my life was playerl. Then, a week later, we had another game but this time I went straight from church. Consequently, I did not play as well; missed a lot of passes and shots. This proved to me that things use of computers, my hand-eye coordination improved. Can you imagine being able to learn about people in faraway places, their cultures, ethicities and relgion? Well now this is more than possible through the advances in technology.

My aunt and uncle live in @LOCATION3 and they were just blessed with a beautiful baby boy, @LOCATION4. Since we are only graced with their presenced about once a year we begin to miss them. But now through skype, email and facebook, we are able to stay updated on the success and growth of @LOCATION4 as well as @CAPS2 they have recently traveled to. Also @PERCENT1 as the teenage population in the @CAPS3.S spend at least four hours a day @CAPS4, tweeting or using facebook to stay in touch with their friends.

The grass was really slippery from when I got @CAPS6 wet, so they slipped, and fell down. @PERSON3 slipped first, but she took @LOCATION3 down with her when she was trying to get back up. We all started throwing water balloons at them, which made it harder for them to get up. @PERSON3 managed to get up she went on the side where her team was.

Then @LOCATION3 threw at @PERSON2, and after @PERSON3 at @LOCATION2.

We walked another step closer. @PERSON4 and I were going back and forth at each other, but @PERSON4 had no more water balloons after a while and her water gun was empty so I beat her. We moved another step closer. @LOCATION3, and I easily soaked @PERSON3 down. My team had had won! We all cheered, then went back inside to dry off, and have some ice cream to celebrate my teams success.

17930,7,I remember the time I was patient with my parents. It started when I saw this game I wanted at the store. Kindly I asked my dad to get it for so he said he would get it for on the following weekend. So I had to be patient and wait for the weekend to come. I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it a lot not remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom. Well the weekend finally came and when I asked my dad was he ready to go he said no. When I asked my dad why not he said it was because I didnít keep my mouth shut so my mom didnít want me to have it at the moment. Now I was angry of course because my mom always says nor has something to say to my dad and me when I get a game. Just then my dad walked in the room and said maybe tomorrow that so happened to be @DATE1 he said. I could borrow money from my grandma and get it then. Thatís exactly what I did and I got my game. Later my dad gave her back her money and we were all happy. The point is that it took a lot patience to get my reward.,9,12,,21,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,

1365,1,"Dear Newspaper, I think that when kids or even adults get computers, then they would not use it for good causes. When people get computers they spend more time inside and on them. They need to get outside get some exercise. Even little things like, if your going to your friends house, then take a jog there instead of your bike. When people spend more time on their computers than talking to your freinds, then they will be low on socializing and, after awile won't know how to communicate with people. All they would have to do is set a time limit on their computer and only use it for work otherwise. Computers could also be used for good things. If you have a project for school and need to type it up on the computer or find pictures on the internet then the computer would be a good resource. If you have a job for working with computers or fixing computers, then you would spend a lot of time on your computer. It also lets you interact with people on the othe side of the world. You can also learn about interesting facts or places. Computers could also be used for bad reasons. When people use it they could just use it to play this cool new video game they got. This can lead them into getting obese. They can also use it for sexual harrasment for stalking people. People can also use it for horrible things like selling or buying drugs or illegal things. So as you can see computers aren't safe in a lot of ways. I hope you can read and understand all the important facts explaining my reasons and consider them.

For example, an existing law made it so that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which meant that a dirigible could not tie up to the building or approach the area. Another problem was making the mast strong enough to support a dirigible. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This shows that improvements had to be made to the mast. One of the biggest problems of building the mast was the issue of the dirigibles being filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The owners of the building remembered the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire in 1937, and how much worse the accident would have been if it had taken place in a densely populated area.",4,3,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three reason for this are, kids don't get any exercise people are doing innapropirate things on them, and they could lead to giving out too much info, which could lead to injury or death. The first reason is that for the amount of time that someone uses a computer, they could be outside enjoying the nice weather well, if it is a nice day of course!

The second reason why computers are a bad thing is because some people are doing innapropriate thing on them. If people are doing such innapropriate things on them why don't the makers of the computers block them? I don't know, I mean what kind of sicko would put those sites up even?

4094,2,"Inappropriate magazines in the reach of children?!? '@CAPS1 just not right', says reporter @PERSON1, 'I think that magazines, books, and other profanities should be out of the reach of children and only discussed when chosen by an adult'. Libraries in the present day need to overseer children when they are looking in the library. If children see something that they want with no guardian then they shouldn't get it, its just that simple.     Although the books can seem inappropriate to some people they should not be taken off the shelves because older books help children learn about what happened in the earlier days, it teaches them some of the ways that we use now, and it shows real stories about people in modern day. For example some of the books about @ORGANIZATION1 connect some people as being to abrassive and mocking, but it just shows what happened long before there were laws for racism. The books about @NUM1 also come provacative to some people because they lost someone close during the bombing, the books teach the kids that not everyone is nice and cruel things happen to some good people.Books about peoples life are also in libraries talking about what happened to them as they were kids or how their parents died of cancer, the books teach the children that outcomes can turn out for the good or the bad.     Some entertainment is not intended for kids to see, for example, pornography and provacative language. Pornography is thought to be an entertainment for adults, but many times it is just something that can scare kids at young ages if they do not know what is really happening. Also, provacative language in a book or on a cd is not something that kids should be listening to. However, they need to learn that if they hear those words they need to know not to say them so they don't get into trouble by their parents.     Books of history are thought to be helpful when children are growing up. Most of the time that is correct, about @PERCENT1 of the children take in the information and use it to help them.

His devious plans and clever mastermining took alot of time to plan out.     People @MONTH1 object to children learning some things about history, but i think it is needed for every child to understand. Everyone needs to know about the ups and downs about their country and the others surrounding them. Children @MONTH1 not understand right now what is wrong with the economy, but they will soon learn when they are adults why people complain so much. Books about this stuff @MONTH1 come offensive to some people, but down the road books are used for many things, we still learn about people from hundreds of years ago.     Children will soon learn of the harsh conditions and the reason why things happen. Without the books and the videos the future will never know what happened. Many young people @MONTH1 change words in books, but the books will always still have what really happened. @CAPS1 why i think that the libraries should keep the books on the shelves, just out of reach of the children",4,4,,4,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15852,6,"The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The number one obstacle was safety. The builders thought to themselves, How are we going to safetly land a dirigible thousands of feet above the ground, while its freely floating in midair? Plus when you attempt this you are above crowded New York streets. If there was ever a malfunction or error while docking then thousands of people may lose their lives. Its much easier lending dirigibles in an open field than in mid-air because you have much more room, your planting the dirigible on secure ground, and you can weigh it down so it doesnt move around. Yet landing in open fields is dangerous because on @DATE1 in @LOCATION2, New Jersey the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This example shows how that if that were to happen in mid-air over a crowded New York City street or block then many more casualties would have been recorded. These obstacles were real and these are some of the reasons why the idea of landing a dirigible in mid-air slowly went away, because it wasnt the most logical idea.",1,2,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6931,3,"The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî had a particulaly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularlly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly peadling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclistís water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more mardid. ìIt didnít really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature.",2,3,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12874,5,"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author was powerful. It had made one feel as though you were accualy there. The author had explained in detail his living enviornment of a small house in a community of other immigreants like them selvs who had band to geather in rough times. During the memoir the author tells about his cuban background, ""Passionate Cuban Music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS1 also tells about @CAPS1's deffinition of family. the ones in his community that wernt just blood related but the neighbors who looked after each other. The author sets the mood of love for his culture and his family within their community. and how his simple three room apartment has become a home.",3,3,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4348,2,"I disagree with library censorship. Every person should be allowed to produce their reflection of their believes or ideas. If certian books found offensive were to be removed from libraries then there would be nothing left for anyone to read.     If parents are concerned with what their children are checking out from the library to read then they should read it before their child to see if they think it is appropriate. In my opinion children should be able to read what ever they like and by doing that they can teach themselves many things.     Books can also help children to escape from every day life.Admitedly, children should not always escape, or use reading to hide from real life, but occasionaly they need too. I know as a young child when things were not going so well I could always turn to reading to get my mind off of the bad things. If children are allowed these escapes they can do better on their school work and with their peers.     Reading can help a child to expand their imaginations. If a child reads a couple times a day it is proven that said child will do better in life. No one likes boring people, and how can you be boring with such a wide imagination?  It is impossible!     In recent online polls, parents who's children can access books say that their children to better in school and in every day life. By reading, these children can easily expand their vocabularies. With this knowlege they can learn with less difficulty and can excell in acedemics with ease.     In conclusion, If certian books are censored from the libraries they will be inavailable for children to read. Children need books to provide an escape, to expand their imaginations, and to help them in school and life. Do not let libraries censor books!",3,4,,3,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
